# Relay Kit

The Relay Kit lets users pay transaction fees (gas fees) using the native blockchain token or ERC-20 tokens. You can pay gas fees using this kit using any ERC-20 token in your Safe, even if you don't have any ETH.

The following guides show how to use the Relay Kit and integrate it into your project by using one of the packs:
