# Relay Kit

The Relay Kit lets users pay transaction fees (gas fees) using the native blockchain token or ERC-20 tokens. Gas fees can be payed with this kit using any ERC-20 token in your Safe, even if there is no native token balance.

The following guides show how to use the Relay Kit and integrate it into your project by using one of the packs:
