# API Kit: Migrating from v1

This guide aims to be a reference of the major changes between v1 and v2 to help those migrating an existing app.

## API Kit constructor

Now it won't be necessary to specify a `txServiceUrl` in those environments where Safe has a Transaction Service running, providing the chain ID will be enough. If you want to use your custom service or use the kit in a chain not supported by a Safe Transaction Service, you can add `txServiceUrl` parameter.

```js
// old:
constructor({ txServiceUrl, ethAdapter }: SafeApiKitConfig)

// new:
constructor({ chainId, txServiceUrl? }: SafeApiKitConfig)
```

## Use the route you prefer

API Kit v1 forced that any custom service was hosted under `/api` route of the URL specified in `txServiceUrl`. This isn't the case anymore, you can specify any route you prefer or subdomain.

Note that if you use a custom service running under `/api` you will now need to migrate as follow:

```js
// old:
const txServiceUrl = 'https://your-transaction-service-domain/'
constructor({ txServiceUrl, ethAdapter }: SafeApiKitConfig)

// new:
const txServiceUrl = 'https://your-transaction-service-domain/api'
constructor({ chainId, txServiceUrl? }: SafeApiKitConfig)
```

## MasterCopy to Singleton

To avoid confusion between terms that have been used as synonyms we aligned all our code to use the word `singleton`.

- Rename type `MasterCopyResponse` to `SafeSingletonResponse`
- Rename method `getServiceMasterCopiesInfo()` to `getServiceSingletonsInfo()`
