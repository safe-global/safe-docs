# Auth Kit

The Auth Kit creates an Ethereum address and authenticates a blockchain account using an email address, social media account, or crypto wallet like Metamask. You can get the Ethereum address and the associated safe addresses as an output for the sign-in process.

The following guides show how to use the Auth Kit and integrate it into your project by using one of the packs:
