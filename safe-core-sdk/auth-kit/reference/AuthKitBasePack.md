# AuthKitBasePack

To be used as part of the Auth Kit, new packs need to extend the `AuthKitBasePack` class. This abstract class provides a common interface that subclasses must implement. It provides the specific Safe common functionality that any custom implementation can take leverage.

## Install dependencies

To use the `AuthKitBasePack`, you need to install the `@safe-global/auth-kit` package.

```bash
yarn add @safe-global/auth-kit
```

## Reference

This class is used to create new packs. Any new pack should extend this class and implement the abstract methods. Extending from the `AuthKitBasePack` class will give the subclass access to the common Safe features like retrieving the associated Safes for a given Ethereum address.

```typescript
class MyPack extends AuthKitBasePack {
  // Implementation of the abstract methods
}
```

## Abstract methods and properties that any pack must implement

These methods and properties are the common interface for all the Auth packs. Check each pack's documentation for more details.

### `isAuthenticated(): boolean`

Any pack extending the `AuthKitBasePack` class must implement the `isAuthenticated()` getter. This method returns a `boolean` indicating whether the user is authenticated.

### `init(options?): Promise<void>`

Provides the initialization options for the required packages, classes and properties.

### `signIn(): Promise<AuthKitSignInData>`

Provides a mechanism to connect to the provider services and returns an Ethereum address that will be used as a signer along with the associated Safe addresses.

### `signOut(): Promise<void>`

Disconnects the provider services and cleans up any data related to the current user.

### `getProvider(): Eip1193Provider | null`

Returns a Web3 provider that can be used to interact with the blockchain (`web3.js` or `ethers.js` for example).

### `getUserInfo(): userInfo`

Returns the user information as a JSON object.

### `subscribe(event, handler)`

Provides a way to subscribe to events

### `unsubscribe(event, handler)`

Provides a way to unsubscribe from an event.

## Specific `AuthKitBasePack` methods

These methods provide the functionality associated with Safe so they can be used in the implementation of the packs.

### `getSafes(txServiceUrl?): Promise<safes[]>`

Returns the list of Safes associated with the signer address by internally calling the `getAddress()` method.

**Parameters**

- `txServiceUrl`(optional): The Safe Transaction Service URL to retrieve the Safes associated with the owner (signer).

**Returns**

- `safes[]`: The list of Safes associated with the owner (signer).

### `getAddress(): Promise<address>`

Returns the Ethereum address extracted from the provider retrieved by `getProvider()`. This returns a Safe owner (signer).

**Returns**

- `address`: The Ethereum address extracted from the provider.

### `getChainId(): Promise<chainId>`

Returns the chain ID of the connected network.

**Returns**

- `chainId`: The chain ID extracted from the provider.
