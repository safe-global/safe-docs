# Safe Apps SDK

The Safe Apps SDK helps developers to build their dapps into the Safe\{Wallet\}. It turns a dapp into an HTML iframe component that can be accessed through Safe. This SDK provides extensive developer tooling to make it easy to create, test, and integrate Safe Apps into Safe. This includes a design system, reusable components, and a Safe App SDK that facilitates communication between the Safe App and Safe.

## Packages

Here are several packages to make it easier to integrate third-party applications (Safe Apps) with [Safe](https://app.safe.global). Check the following diagram to see which package is suitable for you:
