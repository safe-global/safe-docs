# Add or edit chain

Add (or edit) a blockchain network.

## Usage

You can add a new chain by visiting this address: [`http://localhost:8000/cfg/admin/chains/chain/add/`](http://localhost:8000/cfg/admin/chains/chain/add/)

You can edit an existing chain by visiting this address: `http://localhost:8000/cfg/admin/chains/chain/{chain index}/change/` where `{chain index}` is the index of the chain you want to edit.

## Parameters

### `Chain Id`

The unique identifier for the chain.

### `Relevance`

The relative importance of this chain for your project. You can use this value between 0 and 100 to sort chains in the UI.

### `Chain name`

The name of the chain, in plain letters.

### `EIP-3770 short name`

### `Is testnet`

Whether this chain is a testnet. This will be indicated in the UI.

### `RPC authentication`

Whether the RPC endpoint requires authentication to access its data. If `API key path` is set, the API key will be read from the RPC URI.

### `Rpc uri`

The URI of the chain's RPC endpoint. This is the endpoint where the Config Service will fetch the chain's data.

### `Safe Apps RPC authentication`

Whether the RPC endpoint dedicated to Safe Apps will require authentication. If `API key path` is set, the API key will be read from the Safe Apps RPC URI.

### `Safe Apps rpc uri`

The URI of the chain's RPC endpoint dedicated to Safe Apps.

### `Public RPC authentication`

Whether the fallback public RPC endpoint will require authentication. If `API key path` is set, the API key will be read from the Public RPC URI.

### `Public rpc uri`

The URI of the chain's RPC public endpoint.

### `Block explorer uri address template`

### `Currency symbol`

The symbol of the chain's native currency.
