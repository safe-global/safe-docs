# Safe Config Service Django configuration

This document describes how to configure the Config Service through the Django admin panel correctly.

## Overview

The Config Service is a Django application that allows you to manage configurations for your clients. It provides a web interface where you can create, update, and delete configurations, as well as manage groups of permissions to control who can access the configurations.

It assumes you have already set up your [Safe instance](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-infrastructure). If you haven't, please refer to the [Safe Infrastructure Deployment](/core-api/safe-infrastructure-deployment) guide.

The following document concerns only the Safe Config Service. For other services of Safe infrastructure, please refer to the [Safe API documentation](/core-api).
