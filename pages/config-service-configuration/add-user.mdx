# Add user

Add a new Django user. Users are generally admins from your organization that will have partial or total access to the Config Service.

After creation, you can access more options to [edit this user](./edit-user.mdx). 

## Usage

You can edit an existing user by visiting this address: `http://localhost:8000/cfg/admin/auth/user/{user index}/change/`, where `{user index}` is the index of the user you want to edit.

## Parameters

### `Username`

A user name for identifying this user. Must be unique.

### `Password-based authentication`

This section is used to set whether the user will use Django's [built-in authentication system](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/auth/) (`Enabled`), or will use an external authentication system (`Disabled`). If you enable this option, you will need to set a password for the user. If you disable this option, you will have to implement [your own authentication method](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/auth/customizing/).

### `Password`

Opens a section to set a password for the user. 

### `Confirm password`

A confirmation field for the password.
