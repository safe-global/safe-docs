# Build a decentralized application with Safe\{Core\} SDK from scratch.

The goal of this tutorial is to build a decentralized application (dApp) from the ground up using the Safe\{Core\} SDK. The dApp will be a simple wallet that allows users to send and receive Ether and ERC20 tokens, and do so without having to pay any gas fees.

## Create-react-app

Start by creating a new React app using the create-react-app CLI tool:

```bash
npx create-react-app safe-react-app
cd safe-react-app
```

This will create a new directory called safe-react-app, initialize a new git repository, and install all of the dependencies needed to run the app.

You will also need to add polyfills for this tutorial. Polyfills are libraries that provide support for features that are not supported by the browser.

```bash
npm install --save-dev react-app-rewired stream buffer process
```

// Add config-overrides.js to project root and replace react-scripts by react-app-rewired in package.json. Why? See: https://web3auth.io/docs/troubleshooting/webpack-issues#react-create-react-app

## Install Safe\{Core\} SDK

Next, install the Safe\{Core\} SDK:

```bash
npm i  @safe-global/safe-core-sdk-types @safe-global/protocol-kit @safe-global/api-kit @safe-global/auth-kit @safe-global/onramp-kit @safe-global/relay-kit @web3auth/base @web3auth/openlogin-adapter @safe-global/account-abstraction-kit-poc
```

## Import Safe's Account Abstraction React Hooks

The Safe\{Core\} SDK provides a number of React hooks that allow you to interact with the Safe\{Core\} smart contracts. These hooks are used to connect to the blockchain, create a Safe instance, and execute transactions.

To import these hooks, simply copy the file [accountAbstractionContext.jsx](https://github.com/louis-md/safe-sdk-starter-kit) in your project, in the `src`folder.

## Connect your App to the blockchain

The first thing you need to do is connect to the blockchain. This is done by wrapping the default export of your App component with the AccountAbstractionProvider component from the Safe\{Core\} SDK. This component will connect to the blockchain and provide a number of methods for interacting with the Safe\{Core\} smart contracts.

```javascript
import logo from './logo.svg'
import './App.css'
import {
  AccountAbstractionProvider,
  useAccountAbstraction
} from './accountAbstractionContext'

function App () {
  const {
    loginWeb3Auth,
    isAuthenticated,
    ownerAddress,
    relayTransaction,
    logoutWeb3Auth,
    safes,
    deploySafe,
  } = useAccountAbstraction()

  return (
    <div className='App'>
      <header className='App-header'>
        <img src={logo} className='App-logo' alt='logo' />
        <p>Click the button to connect wallet</p>
        {isAuthenticated ? (
          <>
            <p>Wallet Connected: {ownerAddress}</p>
            <button onClick={logoutWeb3Auth}>Log out</button>
            {safes.length > 0 ? (
              <>
                <p>Safe found: {safes[0]}</p>
                <button onClick={relayTransaction}>
                  Create sponsored transaction
                </button>
              </>
            ) : (
              <>
                <button onClick={deploySafe}>Deploy new Safe</button>
              </>
            )}
          </>
        ) : (
          <button onClick={loginWeb3Auth}>Connect Wallet</button>
        )}
      </header>
    </div>
  )
}

const AppWithSafeSDK = () => (
  <AccountAbstractionProvider>
    <App />
  </AccountAbstractionProvider>
)

export default AppWithSafeSDK
```

## Create a Web3Auth account and project Id

Please follow the instructions in the [Web3Auth documentation](https://web3auth.io) to create a Web3Auth account. Then, create a project to get a client ID and client secret. You can then add these values in a .env file, under the names `REACT_APP_WEB3AUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `REACT_APP_WEB3AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`.


The EthersAdapter is a wrapper around the Ethers.js library that provides a consistent interface for interacting with the Safe\{Core\} smart contracts. It also handles signing transactions and sending them to the blockchain.

## Deploy a Safe

The Safe\{Core\} SDK is a library that allows you to interact with the Safe\{Core\} smart contracts (the protocol). The first thing you need to do is create a Safe instance. For a purely javascript approach, please refer to our guide [Integrating Safe\{Core\} SDK](/tutorials/integrating-the-safe-core-sdk).

For this tutorial, we will use the Safe\{Core\} SDK React hooks to deploy a Safe. Simply run the app:

```bash
npm start
```

Visit `localhost:3000` in a web browser. You should see a button to connect your wallet. Please click on it.

### Connect wallet

You can use either an email address or connect with a social media account to login. You can also use your own wallet, like Metamask or Brave wallet. Once you have logged in, you should see a button to deploy a Safe.

### Get test Ether

You will need some test Ether to deploy the Safe\{Core\} smart contracts. You can get some test Ether from the [Rinkeby faucet](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/). Or send us some kudos on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/safe_global) or [Github](https://github.com/safe-global) and to get some test Ether directly from us!

## Test your app

You can now use your app and explore its code! An easy way to test your implementation is to try to relay a transaction without paying for its gas.

### Submit gasless transactions

Once you have a Safe deployed, you can use it to execute gasless transactions. The Safe\{Core\} SDK provides a number of methods for executing transactions purely in javascript. You can explore them in the next pages of [Safe\{Core\} SDK documentation](https://safe-global.gitbook.io/safe-core-sdk/)!

For now, we'll use this test ether to deploy a Safe right from the app. You should see a button to deploy a Safe. Click on it to trigger a new transaction, and confirm it in your wallet.

## Next steps

You can now use the Safe\{Core\} SDK to build your own decentralized application. You can find more information about the Safe\{Core\} SDK in our [community resources](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/safe-core-sdk).
