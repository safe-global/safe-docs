# Starter Kit

The [Starter Kit](../sdk/starter-kit) is the starting point for interacting with the Safe smart account using a TypeScript interface.

The Starter Kit is built on top of several kits from the Safe\{Core\} SDK, leveraging and abstracting the complex logic. At the same time, it's modular and customizable, offering the most simplified way to deploy new accounts and handle the Safe transaction flow in all its different forms:

- User operations
- Multi-signature transactions
- Off-chain and on-chain messages

  />
