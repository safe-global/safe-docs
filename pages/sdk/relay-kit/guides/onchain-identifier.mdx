# Track ERC-4337 transactions with an onchain identifier

In this guide, you will learn how to get an identifier and track all your ERC-4337 Safe transactions onchain by attaching it to the user operation's `callData`.

This guide summarizes all the steps included in the [Safe accounts with the Safe4337Module guide](./4337-safe-sdk.mdx), with an additional step to add the `onchainIdentifier` to your Safe transactions. If you already have the Relay Kit integrated, continue reading to learn how to get your onchain identifier, and feel free to jump straight to [step number five](#add-the-onchainidentifier-to-the-calldata) to learn how to use it afterward.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).
- A [Pimlico account](https://dashboard.pimlico.io) and an API key.

## Steps

<Steps>

  ### Imports

  Here are all the necessary imports for this guide.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  import { Safe4337Pack } from '@safe-global/relay-kit'
  import { concat, toHex } from 'viem'
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  ### Get your on-chain identifier

  This identifier is unique for every project and has a length of 16 bytes. You can create a random one or derive it from a text string, maybe from your project name:

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  const onchainIdentifier = toHex(
    'TEXT_TO_DERIVE_THE_IDENTIFIER', // Could be your project name
    { size: 16 }
  )
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  If you are applying to the [Safe\{Core\} Gas Station Program](https://safe.global/gas-station), make sure to provide the value of `onchainIdentifier` in the [Gas Station form](https://wn2n6ocviur.typeform.com/gasstationapp) when asked.

  ### Initialize the `Safe4337Pack`

  Feel free to skip this step if you have the `Safe4337Pack` already integrated into your application.

  Check the [Safe4337Module guide](./4337-safe-sdk.mdx#initialize-the-safe4337pack) to get all the details on the different ways of initializing the `Safe4337Pack`, whether there is a new Safe to deploy or an existing one to use, as well as several possible configurations for the Paymaster.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  const safe4337Pack = await Safe4337Pack.init({
    provider,
    signer,
    bundlerUrl,
    options: {
      safeAddress
    },
    paymasterOptions: {
      isSponsored,
      paymasterUrl,
      paymasterAddres,
      paymasterTokenAddress,
      sponsorshipPolicyId // Don't forget about your sponsorship policy id
    }
  })
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  ### Create a user operation

  To create a Safe user operation, use the `createTransaction()` method. This method takes the array of transactions to execute and returns a `SafeOperation` object.
  
  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  // Define the transactions to execute
  const transaction1 = { to, data, value }
  const transaction2 = { to, data, value }

  // Build the transaction array
  const transactions = [transaction1, transaction2]

  // Create the SafeOperation with all the transactions
  const safeOperation = await safe4337Pack.createTransaction({ transactions })
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  The `safeOperation` object has the `data` and `signatures` properties, which contain all the information about the transaction batch and the signatures of the Safe owners, respectively.

  ### Add the `onchainIdentifier` to the `callData`

  Once the `safeOperation` is ready, you need to add the `onchainIdentifier` at the end of the ERC-4337 user operation `callData`.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  safeOperation.data.callData = concat([
    safeOperation.data.callData as `0x{string}`,
    onchainIdentifier
  ]).toString()

  const identifiedSafeOperation = await safe4337Pack.getEstimateFee({
    safeOperation
  })
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  Once added, the Safe owners can sign the `identifiedSafeOperation`.

  ### Sign the user operation

  Before sending the user operation to the bundler, the `safeOperation` object must be signed with the connected signer. The `signSafeOperation()` method, which receives a `SafeOperation` object, generates a signature that will be checked when the `Safe4337Module` validates the user operation.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  const signedSafeOperation = await safe4337Pack.signSafeOperation(safeOperation)
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  ### Submit the user operation

  Once the `safeOperation` object is signed, we can call the `executeTransaction()` method to submit the user operation to the bundler.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  const userOperationHash = await safe4337Pack.executeTransaction({
    executable: signedSafeOperation
  })
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  Once the transaction is executed, you will see the `onchainIdentifier` included at the end of the user operation `callData`. 

  ### Check the transaction status

  To check the transaction status, we can use the `getTransactionReceipt()` method, which returns the transaction receipt after execution.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  let userOperationReceipt = null

  while (!userOperationReceipt) {
    // Wait 2 seconds before checking the status again
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 2000))
    userOperationReceipt = await safe4337Pack.getUserOperationReceipt(
      userOperationHash
    )
  }
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  Now, tracking all your transactions is possible by performing onchain queries looking for your identifier at the end of the `callData` field.

## Recap and further reading

If you are not using the Safe\{Core\} SDK to submit transactions, the following GitHub repository may be helpful:

- The [safe-onchain-identifiers](https://github.com/5afe/safe-onchain-identifiers) repository showcases where and how to add the identifier at the end of your Safe transactions data without using the Relay Kit and with a low-level detail. Check also the [specific code](https://github.com/5afe/safe-onchain-identifiers/blob/main/test/OnchainIdentifier.ts#L197-L217) where the identifier is concatenated to the `callData`.
