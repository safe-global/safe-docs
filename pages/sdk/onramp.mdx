# Onramp guides

The guides in this section show how to use different onramp services with the Safe SDK. 
With these onramp services, you can enable users to buy cryptocurrencies using their credit card or bank account.
With Monerium, you can even send IBAN transfers from a Safe account to a bank account.

The following guides show how to do onramping with the following services:
- [Onramping with Monerium](./onramp-kit/guides/monerium.mdx): Receive IBAN payments in a Safe and send IBAN transfers from a Safe account.
- [Onramping with Stripe](./onramp-kit/guides/stripe.mdx): Onramp from a bank account or credit card to a Safe account
