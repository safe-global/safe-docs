# Onramp guides

The guides in this section show how to use different onramp services with the Safe\{Core\} SDK. 
With these onramp services, you can enable users to buy cryptocurrencies using their credit card or bank account.
With Monerium, you can even send IBAN transfers from a Safe account to a bank account.

The following guides show how to onramp with the following services:

- [Monerium](./onramp/monerium.mdx)
- [Stripe](./onramp/stripe.mdx)
