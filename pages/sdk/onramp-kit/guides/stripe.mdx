# Integration with Stripe

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
With the deprecation of the Onramp SDK, developers are now directed to integrate directly with Stripe’s Crypto Onramp service.
</Callout>

This guide provides instructions for seamlessly transitioning to [Stripe’s Crypto Onramp]((https://stripe.com/docs/crypto/overview)), allowing users to securely purchase cryptocurrencies within your application.

To use the Stripe Crypto Onramp service, follow these steps:

Apply for the [Stripe Crypto Onramp service](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto).
Obtain your public and private keys from the Stripe dashboard.
Deploy a backend to provide Stripe access keys to your frontend. You can use the [Safe example Stripe](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-core-sdk/tree/main/packages/onramp-kit/example/server) server as a starting point.
Integrate the [Stripe Crypto Onramp SDK](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/integrate-the-onramp) into your frontend.

If you have any questions or encounter any issues, [Stripe support](https://support.stripe.com/) is responsive and helpful.
