# Magic Signer

In this guide, you will learn how to create a [Magic](https://magic.link/) signer that can be added as a Safe owner and used to initialize any of the kits from the Safe\{Core\} SDK.

Check out the [Safe Signers demo app](https://github.com/5afe/safe-signers) on GitHub to follow along this guide with the completed code.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).
- A [Magic account](https://dashboard.magic.link) and an API key.

## Install dependencies

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash
    npm install magic-sdk
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash
    yarn add magic-sdk
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash

## Steps

<Steps>

  ### Imports

  Here are all the necessary imports for this guide.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  import { Magic } from 'magic-sdk'
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  ### Get the API Key

  Check Magic documentation on how to create a new project in their [dashboard](https://dashboard.magic.link) and [get the API key.](https://magic.link/docs/home/quickstart/cli#add-your-api-key)

  Once you have it, we need to initialize the `API_KEY` variable with it.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  const API_KEY = // ...
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  ### Initialize Magic

  Magic initialization is done by instantiating the `Magic` class with an `API_KEY`. Optionally, it also accepts some configuration parameters that can be checked in the [Magic Web API Reference](https://magic.link/docs/api/client-side-sdks/web).

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  const magic = new Magic(API_KEY)
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  ### Login

  To login with an email address or social account you need to call the following method, that will open the popup and request the user to submit the login form.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  await magic.wallet.connectWithUI()
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  ### Get the provider and signer

  Once the user is logged in, we can get the `provider` and `signerAddress`, which is the externally-owned account of the user that was derived from its credentials.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  <Tabs items={['viem']}>
    <Tabs.Tab>
      We can instantiate the provider using `viem` and the following imports:

      ```typescript
      import { createWalletClient, custom } from 'viem'
      import { sepolia } from 'viem/chains'
      ```

      ```typescript
      const provider = createWalletClient({
        chain: sepolia,
        transport: custom(magic.rpcProvider)
      })

      const metadata = await magic.user.getInfo()
      const signerAddress = metadata.publicAddress
      ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
  </Tabs>

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  With the `provider` and `signerAddress` you are ready to instantiate any of the kits from the Safe\{Core\} SDK and setup or use this signer as a Safe owner.


  ### Logout

  Finally, to logout the user you just need to call the following method.
  
  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  await magic.user.logout()
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

</Steps>

## Recap and further reading

After following this guide, we are able to create a Safe signer using Magic and get the `provider` and `signerAddress` required to initialize the kits from the Safe\{Core\} SDK.
