# Dynamic Signer

In this guide, you will learn how to create a [Dynamic](https://dynamic.xyz) signer that can be added as a Safe owner and used to initialize any of the kits from the Safe\{Core\} SDK.

Check out the [Safe Signers demo app](https://github.com/5afe/safe-signers) on GitHub to follow along this guide with the completed code.

Note that this guide will focus on supporting Ethereum and EVM-compatible wallets. You can enable, import and add [more connectors](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/chains/enabling-chains#enabling-a-chain-network) as needed.

## Prerequisites

- A [Dynamic account](https://app.dynamic.xyz) and an environment ID.

## Steps

<Steps>

  ### Imports

  Here are the necessary imports for this guide.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  import { DynamicContextProvider, useDynamicContext, useIsLoggedIn } from '@dynamic-labs/sdk-react-core'
  import { EthereumWalletConnectors, isEthereumWallet } from '@dynamic-labs/ethereum'
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  ### Get the Environment ID

  Once you create a new Dynamic project in [the dashboard](https://app.dynamic.xyz), you will find your environment ID in [the SDK & API Keys page](https://app.dynamic.xyz/dashboard/developer/api).

  Once you have it, you need to initialize the `DYNAMIC_ENVIRONMENT_ID` variable with it.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  const DYNAMIC_ENVIRONMENT_ID = // ...
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  ### Initialize Dynamic

  Dynamic works with React hooks. This means you can wrap your app with the `DynamicContextProvider` and have access to several react hooks like `useDynamicContext()` that will provide all the functionality.

  `DynamicContextProvider` receives an `environmentId` and other configuration options. Check [Dynamic React SDK documentation](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/sdks/react-sdk/providers/dynamiccontextprovider) to learn more about all the different configuration options.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  <DynamicContextProvider
    settings={{
      environmentId: DYNAMIC_ENVIRONMENT_ID,
      walletConnectors: [EthereumWalletConnectors],
      // Add other configuration options as needed
    }}
  >
    <App />
  </DynamicContextProvider>
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  In this guide you will use the `primaryWallet` from the `useDynamicContext()` hook, and the `useIsLoggedIn()` hook.
  
  ```typescript
  const { primaryWallet } = useDynamicContext()
  const isLoggedIn = useIsLoggedIn()
  ```

  ### Login

  In the `App` component, add [the DynamicWidget component](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/sdks/react-sdk/components/dynamicwidget) that will handle all the login and authentication logic for you.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  import { DynamicWidget } from '@dynamic-labs/sdk-react-core'

  const App = () => {
    return (
      <>
        // Your other content here
        <DynamicWidget />
      </>
    )
  }
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  ### Get the provider and signer

  Once the user is logged in through the `DynamicWidget`, you can get the `provider` and `signer`, which is the externally-owned account of the user that was derived from its credentials.
  
  To do that there is a `useEffect()` that executes when any of the `isLoggedIn` and `primaryWallet` variables have their values updated. Once they are all `true`, you have access to the user's connected signer. Note that you should also check that the wallet is an Ethereum wallet using the `isEthereumWallet()` function.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  You can instantiate the provider and signer like so:

  ```typescript
  useEffect(() => {
    const init = async () => {
      if (isLoggedIn && primaryWallet && isEthereumWallet(primaryWallet)) {
        const provider = await primaryWallet.getWalletClient()

        const signer = primaryWallet.address
      }
    }
    init()
  }, [isLoggedIn, primaryWallet])
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}
  
  With the `provider` and `signer` you are ready to instantiate any of the kits from the Safe\{Core\} SDK and set up or use this signer as a Safe owner.

</Steps>

## Recap and further reading

After following this guide, you are able to create a Safe signer using Dynamic and get the `provider` and `signer` required to initialize the kits from the Safe\{Core\} SDK.
