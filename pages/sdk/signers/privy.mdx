# Privy Signer

In this guide, you will learn how to create a [Privy](https://privy.io) signer that can be added as a Safe owner and used to initialize any of the kits from the Safe\{Core\} SDK.

Check out the [Safe Signers demo app](https://github.com/5afe/safe-signers) on GitHub to follow along this guide with the completed code.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).
- A [Privy account](https://dashboard.privy.io) and an App ID.

## Install dependencies

## Steps

<Steps>

  ### Imports

  Here are the necessary imports for this guide.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  import { PrivyProvider, usePrivy, useWallets } from '@privy-io/react-auth'
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  In addition, you will need to import a web3 library of your choice to use in the "Get the provider and signer" section. In this guide, we are using `viem`.

  ### Get the App ID

  Check Privy documentation on how to create a new project in their [dashboard](https://dashboard.privy.io) and [get the client ID](https://docs.privy.io/guide/react/configuration/app-clients#app-clients).

  Once you have it, you need to initialize the `PRIVY_APP_ID` variable with it.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  const PRIVY_APP_ID = // ...
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  ### Initialize Privy

  Privy works with React hooks. This means you can wrap your app with the `PrivyProvider` and have access to several react hooks like `usePrivy()` and `useWallets()` that will provide all the functionality.

  `ProvyProvider` receives an `appId` and a `config` object with different properties. Check [Using the Privy React SDK](https://docs.privy.io/guide/react/concepts/use-privy#the-privyprovider-component) from Privy documentation to learn more about all the different configuration options, appearance, login methods, etc.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  <PrivyProvider
    appId={PRIVY_APP_ID}
    config={{
      embeddedWallets: { 
        createOnLogin: 'users-without-wallets' // defaults to 'off'
      }
    }}
  >
    <App />
  </PrivyProvider>
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  In this guide you will use the following variables and methods from the `usePrivy()` and `useWallets()` React hooks.
  
  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  const { login, logout, ready, authenticated } = usePrivy()
  const { ready: readyWallets, wallets } = useWallets()
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  ### Login

  To login with an email address or social account you need to call the following method, that will open the popup and request the user to submit the login form.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  login()
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  ### Get the provider and signer

  Once the user is logged in, you can get the `provider` and `signer`, which is the externally-owned account of the user that was derived from its credentials.
  
  To do that there is a `useEffect()` that is executed when any of the `ready`, `authenticated`, `readyWallets` and `wallets` variables have its value updated. Once they all are `true` and `wallets` has a length greater than zero, you have access to the `wallets` first element, which is the user's connected signer.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  <Tabs items={['viem']}>
    <Tabs.Tab>
      You can instantiate the provider using `viem` and the following imports:

      ```typescript
      import { createWalletClient, custom } from 'viem'
      import { sepolia } from 'viem/chains'
      ```

      ```typescript
      useEffect(() => {
        const init = async () => {
          if (ready && authenticated && readyWallets && wallets.length > 0 ) {
            const ethereumProvider = await wallets[0].getEthereumProvider()

            const provider = createWalletClient({
              chain: sepolia,
              transport: custom(ethereumProvider)
            })
      
            const signer = wallets[0].address
          }
        }
        init()
      }, [ready, authenticated, readyWallets, wallets])
      ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
  </Tabs>
  
  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  With the `provider` and `signer` you are ready to instantiate any of the kits from the Safe\{Core\} SDK and set up or use this signer as a Safe owner.

  ### Logout

  Finally, to logout the user, call the `logout()` method.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  logout()
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

</Steps>

## Recap and further reading

After following this guide, you are able to create a Safe signer using Privy and get the `provider` and `signer` required to initialize the kits from the Safe\{Core\} SDK.
