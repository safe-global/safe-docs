# Passkeys Signer

In this guide, you will learn how to create a Passkey signer that can be added as a Safe owner and used to initialize any of the kits from the Safe\{Core\} SDK.

**Note:** Please always use a combination of passkeys and other authentication methods to ensure the security of your users' assets.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).
- Passkeys feature is available only in [secure contexts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts) (HTTPS), in some or all [supporting browsers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Authentication_API#browser_compatibility).

## Steps

  ### Imports

  Here are the necessary imports for this guide.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  import { extractPasskeyData } from '@safe-global/protocol-kit'
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  In addition, you will need to import a web3 library of your choice to use in the "Get the provider and signer" section. In this guide, we are using `viem`.

  ### Create a passkey

  Firstly, you need to generate a passkey credential using the WebAuthn API in a supporting browser environment.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  const RP_NAME = 'Safe Smart Account'
  const USER_DISPLAY_NAME = 'User display name'
  const USER_NAME = 'User name'

  const passkeyCredential = await navigator.credentials.create({
    publicKey: {
      pubKeyCredParams: [
        {
          alg: -7,
          type: 'public-key'
        }
      ],
      challenge: crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(32)),
      rp: {
        name: RP_NAME
      },
      user: {
        displayName: USER_DISPLAY_NAME,
        id: crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(32)),
        name: USER_NAME
      },
      timeout: 60_000,
      attestation: 'none',
    },
  })
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  After generating the `passkeyCredential` object, you need to create a new object with the `PasskeyArgType` type that will contain the `rawId` and the `coordinates` information.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  if (!passkeyCredential) {
    throw Error('Passkey creation failed: No credential was returned.')
  }

  const passkey = await extractPasskeyData(passkeyCredential)
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  At this point, it's critical to securely store the information in the `passkey` object in a persistent service. Losing access to this data will result in the user being unable to access their passkey and, therefore, their Safe Smart Account.

  ### Get the provider and signer

  Once the passkey is created, you can get the `provider` and `signer`, which is the externally-owned account of the user that was derived from its credentials.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  <Tabs items={['viem']}>
    <Tabs.Tab>
      You can instantiate the provider using `viem` and the following imports:

      ```typescript
      import { createWalletClient, http } from 'viem'
      import { sepolia } from 'viem/chains'
      ```

      ```typescript
      const provider = createWalletClient({
        chain: sepolia,
        transport: http('https://rpc.ankr.com/eth_sepolia')
      })

      const signer = passkey
      ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
  </Tabs>

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  With the `provider` and `signer` you are ready to instantiate any of the kits from the Safe\{Core\} SDK and set up or use this signer as a Safe owner.

</Steps>

## Recap and further reading

After following this guide, you are able to create a Safe signer using passkeys and get the `provider` and `signer` required to initialize the kits from the Safe\{Core\} SDK.
