# Safe\{Core\} SDK

The Safe\{Core\} SDK aims to bring Account Abstraction to life by integrating Safe with different third parties. This SDK helps developers to abstract the complexity of setting up a smart contract account.

The Safe\{Core\} SDK groups its functionality into five different kits:

## Protocol Kit

The [Protocol Kit](./protocol-kit.mdx) helps interact with the Safe Smart Account contracts. It enables the creation of new Safe accounts, updating their configuration, and signing and executing transactions, among other features.

- Modular and customizable smart contract accounts
- Battle-tested security
- Transaction batching

## Auth Kit

The [Auth Kit](./auth-kit.mdx) creates externally owned accounts and authenticates them using an email address, a social media account, or a crypto wallet account.

- Easy onboarding using SafeAuth
