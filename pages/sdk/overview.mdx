# Safe\{Core\} SDK

The Safe\{Core\} SDK aims to bring Account Abstraction to life by integrating Safe with different third parties. This SDK helps developers to abstract the complexity of setting up a smart contract account.

The Safe\{Core\} SDK groups its functionality into five different kits:

## Protocol Kit

The [Protocol Kit](./protocol-kit.mdx) helps interact with Safe Smart Accounts. It enables the creation of new Safe accounts, updating their configuration, and signing and executing transactions, among other features.

- Modular and customizable smart contract accounts
- Battle-tested security
- Transaction batching

</Grid>

## API Kit

The [API Kit](./api-kit.mdx) helps interact with the Safe Transaction Service API. It helps share transactions among the signers and get information from a Safe account. For example, the configuration or transaction history.

</Grid>

## Relay Kit

The [Relay Kit](./relay-kit.mdx) enables ERC-4337 with Safe and allows users to pay for the transaction fees from their Safe account using the blockchain native token, ERC-20 tokens, or get their transactions sponsored.

- Use ERC-4337 with Safe
- Gas-less experiences using Gelato
- Sponsored transaction
- Pay fees in ERC-20 tokens
