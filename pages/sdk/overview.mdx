# Safe\{Core\} SDK

The Safe\{Core\} SDK aims to bring Account Abstraction to life by integrating Safe with different third parties. This SDK helps developers to abstract the complexity of setting up a smart contract account.

<Callout type="warning">
  **Build Compatibility:** The Safe\{Core\}Â SDK kits are only available in CommonJS build format.
</Callout>

The Safe\{Core\} SDK groups its functionality into four different kits:

## Starter Kit

The [Starter Kit](../sdk/starter-kit) is the starting point for interacting with the Safe smart account. It leverages and abstracts the complex logic from other kits while being modular and customizable, offering the most simplified way to deploy new accounts and handle the Safe transaction flow in all its different forms:

- User operations
- Multi-signature transactions
- Off-chain and on-chain messages

    url={'./starter-kit'}

  />
</Grid>

## Protocol Kit

The [Protocol Kit](./protocol-kit.mdx) helps interact with Safe Smart Accounts. It enables the creation of new Safe accounts, updating their configuration, and signing and executing transactions, among other features.

- Modular and customizable smart contract accounts
- Battle-tested security
- Transaction batching

    title={'Protocol Kit'}
    description={'Learn about the Protocol Kit and the Safe Smart Account contracts integration.'}
    url={'./protocol-kit'}
    newTab={false}
  />
</Grid>

## API Kit

The [API Kit](./api-kit.mdx) helps interact with the Safe Transaction Service API. It helps share transactions among the signers and get information from a Safe account. For example, the configuration or transaction history.

<Grid container mt={3}>
  <CustomCard
    title={'API Kit'}
    description={'Learn about the API Kit and the integration with the Safe Transaction Service.'}
    url={'./api-kit'}
    newTab={false}
  />
</Grid>

## Relay Kit

The [Relay Kit](./relay-kit.mdx) enables transaction relaying with Safe and allows users to pay for the transaction fees from their Safe account using the blockchain native token, ERC-20 tokens, or get their transactions sponsored.

- Use ERC-4337 with Safe
- Gas-less experiences using Gelato
- Sponsored transaction
- Pay fees in ERC-20 tokens
