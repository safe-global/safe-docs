# Deploy a Safe

In this guide, you will learn how to deploy a new Safe using the Protocol Kit. This process includes initializing the Protocol Kit, setting up your Safe configuration, and executing the deployment.

For more detailed information, see the [Protocol Kit Reference](../../../protocol-kit/reference/safe.mdx).

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

## Install dependencies

First, you need to install the Protocol Kit.

<CH.Section>
  <CH.Code style={{ boxShadow: 'none' }}>
    ```bash pnpm
    pnpm add @safe-global/protocol-kit
    ```

    ```bash npm
    npm install @safe-global/protocol-kit
    ```

    ```bash yarn
    yarn add @safe-global/protocol-kit
    ```
  </CH.Code>
</CH.Section>

## Steps

<Steps>

  ### Imports

  Import the `Safe` class from the Protocol Kit.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  import Safe from '@safe-global/protocol-kit'
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  ### Create a signer

  You need a signer to instantiate the Protocol Kit. This example uses a private key to obtain a signer, but other `EIP-1193` compatible signers are also supported. For more detailed information on the available options, please refer to the [Protocol Kit reference](../../reference/safe.mdx#initialization).

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  const SIGNER_PRIVATE_KEY = // ...
  const RPC_URL = 'https://rpc.ankr.com/eth_sepolia'
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  ### Initialize the Protocol Kit

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  Initialize the Protocol Kit with the `provider`, `signer`, and the `predictedSafe` configuration. The `predictedSafe` property is used to specify the expected configuration of the Safe account, For more detailed information on configuring this and other properties, please refer to our [Protocol Kit reference](../../reference/safe.mdx#initialization).

  ```typescript
  // Define your Safe configuration
  const predictedSafe = {
    safeAccountConfig: {
      owners: ['0xOwner1', '0xOwner2', '0xOwner3'], // In this example, 3 owners
      threshold: 2 // Requires at least 2 signatures to approve a transaction
    }
  }

  // Initialize the Protocol Kit with the predictedSafe
  const protocolKit = await Safe.init({
    provider: RPC_URL,
    signer: SIGNER_PRIVATE_KEY,
    predictedSafe
  })
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  ### Predict your Safe address

  You can predict your Safe address by using the `getAddress` method in the Protocol Kit.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  const safeAddress = await protocolKit.getAddress()
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  ### Create the deployement transaction

  Now, generate the transaction to deploy the Safe and execute it using the Protocol Kit.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  const deploymentTransaction = await protocolKit.createSafeDeploymentTransaction()
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  ### Execute the deployement transaction

  You can execute the deployement transaction using the integrated signer or your preferred external Ethereum client.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  const client = await protocolKit.getSafeProvider().getExternalSigner()

  const txHash = await client.sendTransaction({
    to: deploymentTransaction.to,
    value: BigInt(deploymentTransaction.value),
    data: deploymentTransaction.data as `0x${string}`,
    chain: sepolia
  })

  const txReceipt = await client.waitForTransactionReceipt({ hash: txHash })
  ```

  ### Reconnect the `protocolKit` to the newly deployed Safe

Once the deployment transaction has been successfully executed, it's necessary to reconnect your Protocol Kit instance to the address of the newly created Safe using the `connect` Method

```typescript
// Reconnect to the newly deployed Safe using the protocol-kit
protocolKit = await protocolKit.connect({ safeAddress })

// Confirm the Safe is deployed and fetch properties
console.log("Is Safe deployed:", await protocolKit.isSafeDeployed())
console.log("Safe Address:", await protocolKit.getAddress())
console.log("Safe Owners:", await protocolKit.getOwners())
console.log("Safe Threshold:", await protocolKit.getThreshold())
```


</Steps>


## Recap and further reading

After following this guide, you are able to deploy new Safe accounts with the Protocol Kit.
