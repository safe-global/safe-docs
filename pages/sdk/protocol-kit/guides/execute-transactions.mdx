# Execute transactions

In this quickstart guide, you will create a 2 of 3 multi-sig Safe and propose and execute a transaction to send some ETH out of this Safe.

To find more details and configuration options for available methods, see the [Protocol Kit reference](./protocol-kit/reference).

### Prerequisites

1. [Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
2. Three externally-owned accounts with Testnet ETH in at least one account

### Install dependencies

First, we need to install some dependencies.

```bash
yarn add @safe-global/protocol-kit \
  @safe-global/api-kit \
  @safe-global/safe-core-sdk-types
```

### Initialize Signers and Providers

The signers trigger transactions to the Ethereum blockchain or off-chain transactions. The provider connects to the Ethereum blockchain.

You can get a public RPC URL from [Chainlist](https://chainlist.org), however, public RPC URLs can be unreliable so you can also try a dedicated provider like Infura or Alchemy.

For this guide, we will be creating a Safe on the Sepolia Testnet.

```tsx
// https://chainlist.org/?search=sepolia&testnets=true
const RPC_URL = 'https://eth-sepolia.public.blastapi.io'

// Initialize signers
const OWNER_1_ADDRESS = // ...
const OWNER_1_PRIVATE_KEY = // ...

const OWNER_2_ADDRESS = // ...
const OWNER_2_PRIVATE_KEY = // ...

const OWNER_3_ADDRESS = // ...

const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(RPC_URL)
const owner1Signer = new ethers.Wallet(OWNER_1_PRIVATE_KEY, provider)
```

### Initialize the API Kit

The [API Kit](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-core-sdk/tree/main/packages/api-kit) consumes the [Safe Transaction Service API](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-transaction-service). To use this library, create a new instance of the `SafeApiKit` class, imported from `@safe-global/api-kit`. In chains where Safe provides a Transaction Service, it's enough to specify the `chainId.` You can specify your own service using the optional `txServiceUrl` parameter.

You will be using Sepolia for this tutorial, however, you can also get [service URLs for different networks](../core-api/transaction-service-supported-networks.md).

```tsx
import SafeApiKit from '@safe-global/api-kit'

const apiKit = new SafeApiKit({
  chainId: 1n
})

// Or using a custom service
const apiKit = new SafeApiKit({
  chainId: 1n, // set the correct chainId
  txServiceUrl: 'https://url-to-your-custom-service'
})
```

### Initialize the Protocol Kit

The `SafeFactory` class allows the deployment of new Safe accounts while the `Safe` class represents an instance of a specific one.

```tsx
import { SafeFactory } from '@safe-global/protocol-kit'

const safeFactory = await SafeFactory.init({
  provider: RPC_URL,
  signer: OWNER_1_PRIVATE_KEY
})
```

### Deploy a Safe

Calling the `deploySafe` method will deploy the desired Safe and return a Protocol Kit initialized instance ready to be used. Check the [method reference](./protocol-kit/reference/safe-factory.mdx#deploysafe) for more details on additional configuration parameters and callbacks.

```tsx
import { SafeAccountConfig } from '@safe-global/protocol-kit'

const safeAccountConfig: SafeAccountConfig = {
  owners: [
    await OWNER_1_ADDRESS,
    await OWNER_2_ADDRESS,
    await OWNER_3_ADDRESS
  ],
  threshold: 2,
  // Optional params
}

/* This Safe is tied to owner 1 because the factory was initialized with the owner 1 as the signer. */
const protocolKitOwner1 = await safeFactory.deploySafe({ safeAccountConfig })

const safeAddress = await protocolKitOwner1.getAddress()

console.log('Your Safe has been deployed:')
console.log(`https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/${safeAddress}`)
console.log(`https://app.safe.global/sep:${safeAddress}`)
```

### Send ETH to the Safe

You will send some ETH to this Safe.

```tsx
const safeAddress = protocolKit.getAddress()

const safeAmount = ethers.parseUnits('0.01', 'ether').toHexString()

const transactionParameters = {
  to: safeAddress,
  value: safeAmount
}

const tx = await owner1Signer.sendTransaction(transactionParameters)

console.log('Fundraising.')
console.log(`Deposit Transaction: https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/${tx.hash}`)
```

## Making a transaction from a Safe

The first signer will sign and propose a transaction to send 0.005 ETH out of the Safe. Then, the second signer will add their own proposal and execute the transaction since it meets the 2 of 3 thresholds.

At a high level, making a transaction from the Safe requires the following steps:

### Overview

The high-level overview of a multi-sig transaction is PCE: Propose. Confirm. Execute.

1. **First signer proposes a transaction**
   1. Create transaction: define the amount, destination, and any additional data
   2. Perform an off-chain signature of the transaction before proposing
   3. Submit the transaction and signature to the Safe Transaction Service
2. **Second signer confirms the transaction**
   1. Get pending transactions from the Safe service
   2. Perform an off-chain signature of the transaction
   3. Submit the signature to the service
3. **Anyone executes the transaction**
   1. In this example, the first signer executes the transaction
   2. Anyone can get the pending transaction from the Safe service
   3. Account executing the transaction pays the gas fee

### Create a transaction

For more details on what to include in a transaction see [`createTransaction`](./protocol-kit/reference/safe.mdx#createtransaction) method.

```tsx
import { MetaTransactionData } from '@safe-global/safe-core-sdk-types'

// Any address can be used. In this example you will use vitalik.eth
const destination = '0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045'
const amount = ethers.parseUnits('0.005', 'ether').toString()

const safeTransactionData: MetaTransactionData = {
  to: destination,
  data: '0x',
  value: amount
}
// Create a Safe transaction with the provided parameters
const safeTransaction = await protocolKitOwner1.createTransaction({ transactions: [safeTransactionData] })
```

### Track the Safe transaction

Optionally, you can track all your Safe transactions on-chain by attaching an on-chain identifier to the `data` property.

This identifier must be unique for every project and has a length of 16 bytes. You can create a random one or derive it from a text string, maybe from your project name:

{/* <!-- vale off --> */}

```typescript
const onchainIdentifier = toHex(
  'TEXT_TO_DERIVE_THE_IDENTIFIER', // It could be your project name
  { size: 16 }
)
```

{/* <!-- vale on --> */}

Once generated, fill the [Ecosystem On-chain Tracking Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfHWSPbSQwmo0mbtuFFewfLvDEOvTxfuvEl7AHOyrFE_dqpwQ/viewform) and provide the value of your `onchainIdentifier`.

Add the `onchainIdentifier` at the end of the Safe transaction `data`.

{/* <!-- vale off --> */}

```typescript
safeTransaction.data.data = concat([
  safeOperation.data.data as `0x{string}`,
  onchainIdentifier
]).toString()
```

{/* <!-- vale on --> */}

### Propose the transaction

To propose a transaction to the Safe Transaction Service we need to call the `proposeTransaction` method from the API Kit instance.

For a full list and description of the properties see [`proposeTransaction`](../reference-sdk-api-kit/proposetransaction) in the API Kit reference.

```tsx
// Deterministic hash based on transaction parameters
const safeTxHash = await protocolKitOwner1.getTransactionHash(safeTransaction)

// Sign transaction to verify that the transaction is coming from owner 1
const senderSignature = await protocolKitOwner1.signHash(safeTxHash)

await apiKit.proposeTransaction({
  safeAddress,
  safeTransactionData: safeTransaction.data,
  safeTxHash,
  senderAddress: OWNER_1_ADDRESS,
  senderSignature: senderSignature.data,
})
```

### Get pending transactions

Recall that you created the `apiKit` in [Initialize the API Kit](./protocol-kit/#initialize-the-api-kit).

```tsx
const pendingTransactions = (await apiKit.getPendingTransactions(safeAddress)).results
```

### Confirm the transaction: Second confirmation

When owner 2 is connected to the application, the Protocol Kit should be initialized again with the existing Safe address the address of the owner 2 instead of the owner 1.

```tsx
// Assumes that the first pending transaction is the transaction you want to confirm
const transaction = pendingTransactions[0]
const safeTxHash = transaction.safeTxHash

const protocolKitOwner2 = await Safe.init({
  provider: RPC_URL,
  signer: OWNER_2_PRIVATE_KEY,
  safeAddress
})

const signature = await protocolKitOwner2.signHash(safeTxHash)
const response = await apiKit.confirmTransaction(safeTxHash, signature.data)
```

### Execute the transaction

Anyone can execute the Safe transaction once it has the required number of signatures. In this example, owner 1 will execute the transaction and pay for the gas fees.

```tsx
const safeTransaction = await apiKit.getTransaction(safeTxHash)
const executeTxResponse = await protocolKit.executeTransaction(safeTransaction)
const receipt = await executeTxResponse.transactionResponse?.wait()

console.log('Transaction executed:')
console.log(`https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/${receipt.transactionHash}`)
```

### Confirm that the transaction was executed

You know that the transaction was executed if the balance in your Safe changes.

```tsx
const afterBalance = await protocolKit.getBalance()

console.log(`The final balance of the Safe: ${ethers.formatUnits(afterBalance, 'ether')} ETH`)
```

```bash
$ node index.js

Fundraising.

Initial balance of Safe: 0.01 ETH
Buying a car.
The final balance of the Safe: 0.005 ETH
```

### Conclusion

In this quickstart, you learned how to create and deploy a new Safe account and to propose and then execute a transaction from it.
