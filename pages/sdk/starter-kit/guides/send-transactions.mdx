# Send Transactions

In this guide, you will learn how to create Safe transactions, sign them, collect the signatures from the different owners, and execute them.

For more detailed information, see the [Starter Kit Reference](../../../reference-sdk-starter-kit/overview.mdx).

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

## Install dependencies

First, you need to install some dependencies.

```bash
pnpm add @safe-global/starter-kit
```

## Steps

<Steps>

  ### Imports

  Here are all the necessary imports for this guide.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  import { createSafeClient } from '@safe-global/sdk-starter-kit'
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  ### Create a signer

  Firstly, you need to get a signer, which will be the owner of a Safe account after it's deployed.

  This example uses a private key, but any way to get an EIP-1193 compatible signer can be used.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  const SIGNER_ADDRESS = // ...
  const SIGNER_PRIVATE_KEY = // ...
  const RPC_URL = 'https://rpc.ankr.com/eth_sepolia'
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  ### Initialize the `SafeClient`

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  <Tabs items={['New Safe account', 'Existing Safe account']}>
    <Tabs.Tab>
      When deploying a new Safe account, you need to pass the configuration of the Safe in the `safeOptions` property. The Safe account is configured with your signer as the only owner in this case.

      ```typescript
      const safeClient = await createSafeClient({
        provider: RPC_URL,
        signer: SIGNER_PRIVATE_KEY,
        safeOptions: {
          owners: [SIGNER_ADDRESS],
          threshold: 1
        }
      })
      ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>
      When connecting an existing Safe account, you need to pass the `safeAddress`.

      ```typescript
      const safeClient = await createSafeClient({
        provider: RPC_URL,
        signer: SIGNER_PRIVATE_KEY,
        safeAddress: '0x...'
      })
      ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
  </Tabs>

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  ### Create a Safe transaction

  Create an array of Safe transactions to execute.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  const transactions = [{
    to: '0x...',
    data: '0x',
    value: '0'
  }]
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  ### Send the Safe transaction

  If you configured your Safe with `threshold` equal to `1`, calling the [`send`](../../../reference-sdk-starter-kit/safe-client/send.mdx) method will execute the Safe transaction. However, if the `threshold` is greater than `1` the other owners of the Safe will need to confirm the transaction until the required number of signatures are collected.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  const txResult = await safeClient.send({ transactions })

  const safeTxHash = txResult.transactions?.safeTxHash
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  ### Confirm the Safe transaction

  If the Safe transaction needs to be confirmed by other Safe owners, call the [`confirm`](../../../reference-sdk-starter-kit/safe-client/confirm.mdx) method from a new `SafeClient` instance initialized with each of the signers that need to confirm it.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  const newSafeClient = await createSafeClient({
    provider: RPC_URL,
    signer,
    safeAddress: '0x...'
  })
  ```
  
  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  Finally, retrieve all the pending Safe transactions from the Safe Transaction Service and confirm the one you just created with each missing owner.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  const pendingTransactions = await newSafeClient.getPendingTransactions()

  for (const transaction of pendingTransactions.results) {
    if (transaction.safeTxHash !== safeTxHash) {
      return
    }

    const txResult = await safeClient.confirm({ safeTxHash })
  }
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

</Steps>

## Recap and further reading

After following this guide, you are able to deploy new Safe accounts and create, sign, and execute Safe transactions with the Starter Kit.
