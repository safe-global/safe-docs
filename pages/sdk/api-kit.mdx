# API Kit

The [API Kit](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-core-sdk/tree/main/packages/api-kit) facilitates the interaction with the [Safe Transaction Service API](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-transaction-service), allowing to propose and share transactions with the other signers of a Safe, sending the signatures to the service to collect them, getting information about a Safe (like reading the transaction history, pending transactions, enabled Modules and Guards, etc.), among other features.

## Quickstart

In this guide we will see how to propose transactions to the service and collect the signatures from the owners so they become executable.

For more detailed information, see the guide [Integrating the Protocol Kit and API Kit](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-core-sdk/blob/main/guides/integrating-the-safe-core-sdk.md) and the [API Kit Reference](./api-kit/reference.md).

## Prerequisites

1. [Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
2. A Safe with several signers

## Steps

<Steps>

  ### Install dependencies

  To add the API Kit to your project, run:

  ```bash
  yarn add @safe-global/api-kit
  ```

  ### Imports

  Here are all the necessary imports for this guide.

  ```typescript
  import SafeApiKit from '@safe-global/api-kit'
  import Safe from '@safe-global/protocol-kit'
  ```

  ### Initialize the API Kit

  Firstly, we need to create an instance of the API Kit. In chains where the [Safe Transaction Service](../core-api/transaction-service-overview.mdx) is supported, it's enough to specify the `chainId` property.

  ```typescript
  const apiKit = new SafeApiKit({
    chainId: 1n
  })
  ```

  Alternatively, we can use a custom service using the optional `txServiceUrl` property.

  ```typescript
  const apiKit = new SafeApiKit({
    chainId: 1n, // set the correct chainId
    txServiceUrl: 'https://url-to-your-custom-service'
  })
  ```

  ### Initialize the Protocol Kit

  We need an instance of the Protocol Kit to handle transactions and signatures. To instantiate it, get a provider and signer first.

  For this guide, we will be using Sepolia Testnet.

  ```typescript
  // https://chainlist.org/?search=sepolia&testnets=true
  const RPC_URL = 'https://eth-sepolia.public.blastapi.io'
  const PRIVATE_KEY = '<SIGNER_ADDRESS_PRIVATE_KEY>'
  ```

  After that, we instantiate the Protocol Kit with the `provider`, `signer` and `safeAddress`.

  ```typescript
  const protocolKit = await Safe.create({
    provider: RPC_URL,
    signer: PRIVATE_KEY,
    safeAddress: '<SAFE_ADDRESS>'
  })
  ```

  ### Propose a transaction to the service

  Before a transaction can be executed, any of the Safe signers needs to initiate the process by creating a proposal of a transaction. We send this transaction to the service to make it accessible by the other owners so they can give their approval and sign the transaction as well.

  ```typescript
  // Create transaction
  const safeTransactionData: MetaTransactionData = {
    to: '0x',
    value: '1', // 1 wei
    data: '0x',
    operation: OperationType.Call
  }

  const safeTransaction = await protocolKit.createTransaction({
    transactions: [safeTransactionData]
  })

  const senderAddress = await signer.getAddress()
  const safeTxHash = await protocolKit.getTransactionHash(safeTransaction)
  const signature = await protocolKit.signHash(safeTxHash)

  // Propose transaction to the service
  await apiKit.proposeTransaction({
    safeAddress: await protocolKit.getAddress(),
    safeTransactionData: safeTransaction.data,
    safeTxHash,
    senderAddress,
    senderSignature: signature.data
  })
  ```

  ### Retrieve the pending transactions

  Different methods in the API Kit are available to retrieve pending transactions depending on the situation. To retrieve a transaction given the Safe transaction hash use the method that's not commented.

  ```typescript
  const transaction = await service.getTransaction("<SAFE_TX_HASH>")
  // const transactions = await service.getPendingTransactions()
  // const transactions = await service.getIncomingTransactions()
  // const transactions = await service.getMultisigTransactions()
  // const transactions = await service.getModuleTransactions()
  // const transactions = await service.getAllTransactions()
  ```

  ### Confirm the transaction

  In this step we need to sign the transaction with the Protocol Kit and submit the signature to the Safe Transaction Service using the `confirmTransaction` method.

  ```typescript
  const safeTxHash = transaction.transactionHash
  const signature = await protocolKit.signHash(safeTxHash)

  // Confirm the Safe transaction
  const signatureResponse = await apiKit.confirmTransaction(
    safeTxHash,
    signature.data
  )
  ```

  The Safe transaction is now ready to be executed. This can be done using the Safe\{Wallet\} web interface, the Protocol Kit or any other tool that's available.
