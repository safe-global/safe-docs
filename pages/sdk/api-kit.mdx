# API Kit

The API Kit facilitates the interaction with the [Safe Transaction Service API](../core-api/transaction-service-overview), allowing to propose and share transactions with the other signers of a Safe, sending the signatures to the service to collect them, getting information about a Safe (like reading the transaction history, pending transactions, enabled Modules and Guards, etc.), among other features.
