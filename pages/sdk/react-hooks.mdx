# Safe React Hooks

The Safe React Hooks are the starting point for interacting with the Safe smart account using a React application.

These hooks are built on top of the [Starter Kit](./starter-kit.mdx), which leverages and abstracts the complex logic from several kits from the Safe\{Core\} SDK, allowing you to set a React context that gives access to the exposed Safe functionality everywhere in your application.
