# Send Transactions

This guide will teach you how to deploy new Safe accounts and create, sign, and execute Safe transactions using the Safe React Hooks.

For more detailed information, see the [Safe React Hooks Reference](../../../reference-sdk-react-hooks/overview.mdx).

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

## Install dependencies

First, you need to install some dependencies.

```bash
pnpm add @safe-global/safe-react-hooks
```

## Steps

<Steps>

  ### Imports

  Here are all the necessary imports for this guide.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  import {
    SafeProvider,
    createConfig,
    useSafe,
    useSendTransaction,
    SendTransactionVariables,
    useConfirmTransaction,
    ConfirmTransactionVariables
  } from '@safe-global/safe-react-hooks'
  import { sepolia } from 'viem/chains'
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  ### Create a signer and provider

  Firstly, you need to get a signer, which will be the owner of a Safe account after it's deployed.

  This example uses a private key, but any way to get an EIP-1193 compatible signer can be used.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  const SIGNER_ADDRESS = // ...
  const SIGNER_PRIVATE_KEY = // ...

  const RPC_URL = 'https://rpc.ankr.com/eth_sepolia'
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  ### Initialize the Safe React Hooks

  You need to wrap your app with the [`SafeProvider`](../../../reference-sdk-react-hooks/safeprovider.mdx) to have access to the different Safe React Hooks like `useSendTransaction()`, `useConfirmTransaction()`, and `usePendingTransactions()` that will provide the functionality you need in this guide.

  `SafeProvider` receives a `config` object with different properties to create the global configuration that you can get from the [`createConfig`](../../../reference-sdk-react-hooks/createconfig.mdx) function. 

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  <Tabs items={['New Safe account', 'Existing Safe account']}>
    <Tabs.Tab>
      When deploying a new Safe account for the connected signer, you need to pass the configuration of the Safe in the `safeOptions` property. In this case, the Safe account is configured with your signer as the only owner.

      ```typescript
      const config = createConfig({
        chain: sepolia,
        provider: RPC_URL,
        signer: SIGNER_PRIVATE_KEY,
        safeOptions: {
          owners: [SIGNER_ADDRESS],
          threshold: 1
        }
      })
      ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>
      When connecting an existing Safe account, you need to pass the `safeAddress` property.

      ```typescript
      const config = createConfig({
        chain: sepolia,
        provider: RPC_URL,
        signer: SIGNER_PRIVATE_KEY,
        safeAddress: '0x...'
      })
      ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
  </Tabs>
  
  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  To apply the global configuration to your app, pass the created `config` to the `SafeProvider`.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  <SafeProvider config={config}>
    <App />
  </SafeProvider>
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  ### Create a Safe transaction

  Create an array of Safe transactions to execute.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  const transactions = [{
    to: '0x...',
    data: '0x',
    value: '0'
  }]
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  ### Send the Safe transaction

  Create a `SendTransaction` component in your application to create and send a transaction.

  If you configured your Safe with `threshold` equal to `1`, calling the `sendTransaction` function from the [`useSendTransaction`](../../../reference-sdk-react-hooks/usesendtransaction.mdx) hook will execute the Safe transaction. However, if the `threshold` is greater than `1` the other owners of the Safe will need to confirm the transaction until the required number of signatures are collected.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  <Tabs items={['SendTransaction.tsx']}>
    <Tabs.Tab>
      ```typescript
      function SendTransaction() {
        const { sendTransaction } = useSendTransaction()

        const sendTransactionParams: SendTransactionVariables = {
          transactions
        }

        return (
          <button onClick={() => sendTransaction(sendTransactionParams)}>
            Send Transaction
          </button>
        )
      }

      export default SendTransaction
      ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
  </Tabs>

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  ### Confirm the Safe transaction

  Create a `ConfirmPendingTransactions` component in your application to check the transactions pending for confirmation in case the Safe transaction needs to be confirmed by other Safe owners.
  
  Retrieve all the pending Safe transactions from the Safe Transaction Service by calling the [`getPendingTransaction`](../../../reference-sdk-react-hooks/usesafe/getpendingtransactions.mdx) function from the [`useSafe`](../../../reference-sdk-react-hooks/usesafe.mdx) hook, and call the `confirmTransaction` function from the [`useConfirmTransaction`](../../../reference-sdk-react-hooks/useconfirmtransaction.mdx) hook to confirm them.

  Notice that the `SafeProvider` configuration needs to be initialized with a different Safe owner as the `signer` when confirming a transaction.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  <Tabs items={['ConfirmPendingTransactions.tsx']}>
    <Tabs.Tab>
      ```typescript
      function ConfirmPendingTransactions() {
        const { getPendingTransactions } = useSafe()
        const { data = [] } = getPendingTransactions()
        const { confirmTransaction } = useConfirmTransaction()
  
        return (
          <>
            {data.length > 0 && data.map(tx => (
              <>
                {tx.safeTxHash}
                <button onClick={() => confirmTransaction({
                  safeTxHash: tx.safeTxHash
                })} />
              </>
            ))}
          </>
        )
      }

      export default ConfirmPendingTransactions
      ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
  </Tabs>

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  Once the total number of confirmations reaches the `threshold` of the Safe, the `confirmTransaction` will automatically execute the transaction. 

</Steps>
