# Propose and confirm transactions

In this guide you will learn how to propose transactions to the service and collect the signatures from the owners so they become executable.

For more detailed information, see the [API Kit Reference](../../../reference-sdk-api-kit/overview.mdx).

## Prerequisites

1. [Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
2. A Safe with several signers

## Steps

<Steps>

  ### Install dependencies

  First, you need to install some dependencies.

  ```bash
  yarn add @safe-global/api-kit \
    @safe-global/protocol-kit \
    @safe-global/types-kit
  ```

  ### Imports

  Here are all the necessary imports for this guide.

  ```typescript
  import SafeApiKit from '@safe-global/api-kit'
  import Safe from '@safe-global/protocol-kit'
  import {
    MetaTransactionData,
    OperationType
  } from '@safe-global/types-kit'
  ```

  ### Setup

  We will use a Safe account setup with two or more signers, and threshold two, so at least multiple signatures will need to be collected when executing a transaction.

  ```typescript
  // https://chainlist.org/?search=sepolia&testnets=true
  const RPC_URL = 'https://eth-sepolia.public.blastapi.io'

  const SAFE_ADDRESS = // ...

  const OWNER_1_ADDRESS = // ...
  const OWNER_1_PRIVATE_KEY = // ...

  const OWNER_2_PRIVATE_KEY = // ...
  ```

  ### Initialize the API Kit

  Firstly, you need to create an instance of the API Kit. In chains where the [Safe Transaction Service](../../../core-api/transaction-service-overview.mdx) is supported, it's enough to specify the `chainId` property.

  ```typescript
  const apiKit = new SafeApiKit({
    chainId: 1n
  })
  ```

  Alternatively, you can use a custom service using the optional `txServiceUrl` property.

  ```typescript
  const apiKit = new SafeApiKit({
    chainId: 1n, // set the correct chainId
    txServiceUrl: 'https://url-to-your-custom-service'
  })
  ```

  ### Initialize the Protocol Kit

  To handle transactions and signatures, you need to create an instance of the Protocol Kit with the `provider`, `signer` and `safeAddress`.

  ```typescript
  const protocolKitOwner1 = await Safe.init({
    provider: RPC_URL,
    signer: OWNER_1_PRIVATE_KEY,
    safeAddress: SAFE_ADDRESS
  })
  ```

  ### Propose a transaction to the service

  Before a transaction can be executed, any of the Safe signers needs to initiate the process by creating a proposal of a transaction. This transaction is sent to the service to make it accessible by the other owners so they can give their approval and sign the transaction as well.

  For a full list and description of the properties see [`proposeTransaction`](../../../reference-sdk-api-kit/proposetransaction.mdx) in the API Kit reference.

  ```typescript
  // Create transaction
  const safeTransactionData: MetaTransactionData = {
    to: '0x',
    value: '1', // 1 wei
    data: '0x',
    operation: OperationType.Call
  }

  const safeTransaction = await protocolKitOwner1.createTransaction({
    transactions: [safeTransactionData]
  })

  const safeTxHash = await protocolKitOwner1.getTransactionHash(safeTransaction)
  const signature = await protocolKitOwner1.signHash(safeTxHash)

  // Propose transaction to the service
  await apiKit.proposeTransaction({
    safeAddress: SAFE_ADDRESS,
    safeTransactionData: safeTransaction.data,
    safeTxHash,
    senderAddress: OWNER_1_ADDRESS,
    senderSignature: signature.data
  })
  ```

  ### Retrieve the pending transactions

  Different methods in the API Kit are available to retrieve pending transactions depending on the situation. To retrieve a transaction given the Safe transaction hash use the method that's not commented.

  ```typescript
  const transaction = await service.getTransaction(safeTxHash)
  // const transactions = await service.getPendingTransactions()
  // const transactions = await service.getIncomingTransactions()
  // const transactions = await service.getMultisigTransactions()
  // const transactions = await service.getModuleTransactions()
  // const transactions = await service.getAllTransactions()
  ```

  ### Confirm the transaction

  In this step you need to sign the transaction with the Protocol Kit and submit the signature to the Safe Transaction Service using the [`confirmTransaction`](../../../reference-sdk-api-kit/confirmtransaction.mdx) method.

  ```typescript
  const protocolKitOwner2 = await Safe.init({
    provider: RPC_URL,
    signer: OWNER_2_PRIVATE_KEY,
    safeAddress: SAFE_ADDRESS
  })

  const safeTxHash = transaction.transactionHash
  const signature = await protocolKitOwner2.signHash(safeTxHash)

  // Confirm the Safe transaction
  const signatureResponse = await apiKit.confirmTransaction(
    safeTxHash,
    signature.data
  )
  ```

  The Safe transaction is now ready to be executed. This can be done using the [Safe\{Wallet\} web](https://app.safe.global) interface, the [Protocol Kit](../../../reference-sdk-protocol-kit/transactions/executetransaction.mdx), the [Safe CLI](../../../advanced/cli-reference/tx-service-commands.mdx#execute-pending-transaction) or any other tool that's available.
