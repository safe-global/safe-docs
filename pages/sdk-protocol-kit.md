# Protocol Kit

The [Protocol Kit](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-core-sdk/tree/main/packages/protocol-kit) enables developers to interact with the [Safe contracts](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-contracts) using a TypeScript interface. This Kit can be used to create new Safe accounts, update the configuration of existing Safes, propose and execute transactions, among other features.

## Quickstart

In this quickstart guide, you will create a 2 of 3 multi-sig Safe and propose and execute a transaction to send some ETH out of this Safe.

For a more detailed guide, including how to integrate with `web3.js` and more Safe transaction configuration options, see [Guide: Integrating the Protocol Kit and API Kit](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-core-sdk/blob/main/guides/integrating-the-safe-core-sdk.md) and [Protocol Kit Reference](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-core-sdk/tree/main/packages/protocol-kit#sdk-api).

### Prerequisites

1. [Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
2. Three externally-owned accounts with Testnet ETH in at least one account

### Install dependencies

First, we'll need to install some dependencies from `safe-core-sdk` and the `ethers` library.

To interact with Ethereum and other EVM blockchains in Node, we can either use: web3.js or ethers.js. In this tutorial, we'll use the ethers.js library. To use `web3js`, see [Instantiate an EthAdapter section in Guide: Integrating the Safe Core SDK](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-core-sdk/blob/main/guides/integrating-the-safe-core-sdk.md#instantiate-an-ethadapter).

The Protocol Kit's compatible only with **ethers.js v6**. Make sure you specify this version when installing the SDK.

You can store your environment variables such as private keys in a `.env` file. To read easily from `.env` files, use the `dotenv` library.

```bash
yarn add ethers @safe-global/protocol-kit \
  @safe-global/api-kit \
  @safe-global/safe-core-sdk-types \
  dotenv
```

Create the `.env` file:

```bash
touch .env
```

Put your signing account private keys into the `.env` file you just created.

```bash
export OWNER_1_PRIVATE_KEY='<PRIVATE_KEY>'
export OWNER_2_PRIVATE_KEY='<PRIVATE_KEY>'
export OWNER_3_PRIVATE_KEY='<PRIVATE_KEY>'
```

Create an `index.ts` file that you will use to run the following code snippets.

```bash
touch index.ts
```

Tip: Use [ts-node](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node) to run a Typescript file in Node.js.

```bash
npx ts-node examples/protocol-kit/index.ts
```

### Initialize Signers, Providers, and EthAdapter

The signers trigger transactions to the Ethereum blockchain or off-chain transactions. The provider connects to the Ethereum blockchain.

You can get a public RPC URL from [Chainlist](https://chainlist.org), however, public RPC URLs can be unreliable so you can also try a dedicated provider like Infura or Alchemy.

For this tutorial, we will be creating a Safe on the Goerli Testnet.

```tsx
import { ethers } from 'ethers'
import {Â EthersAdapter } from '@safe-global/protocol-kit'
import dotenv from 'dotenv'

dotenv.config()

// https://chainlist.org/?search=goerli&testnets=true
const RPC_URL='https://eth-goerli.public.blastapi.io'
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(RPC_URL)

// Initialize signers
const owner1Signer = new ethers.Wallet(process.env.OWNER_1_PRIVATE_KEY!, provider)
const owner2Signer = new ethers.Wallet(process.env.OWNER_2_PRIVATE_KEY!, provider)
const owner3Signer = new ethers.Wallet(process.env.OWNER_3_PRIVATE_KEY!, provider)

const ethAdapterOwner1 = new EthersAdapter({
  ethers,
  signerOrProvider: owner1Signer
})
```

### Initialize the API Kit

The [API Kit](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-core-sdk/tree/main/packages/api-kit) consumes the [Safe Transaction Service API](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-transaction-service). To use this library, create a new instance of the `SafeApiKit` class, imported from `@safe-global/api-kit`. In chains where Safe provides a Transaction Service, it's enough to specify the `chainId.` You can specify your own service using the optional `txServiceUrl` parameter.

You will be using Goerli for this tutorial, however, you can also get [service URLs for different networks](./api-supported-networks.md).

```tsx
import SafeApiKit from '@safe-global/api-kit'

const safeApiKit = new SafeApiKit({
  chainId: 1n
})


// or using a custom service
const safeApiKit = new SafeApiKit({
  chainId: 1n, // set the correct chainId
  txServiceUrl: 'https://url-to-your-custom-service'
})
```

### Initialize the Protocol Kit

Goerli is a supported network so you don't need to specify the contract addresses, however, to see how to create a safe on a local or unsupported network, see [Instantiate an EthAdapter](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-core-sdk/blob/main/guides/integrating-the-safe-core-sdk.md#instantiate-an-ethadapter).

Safe Factory is used to create Safes. While Safe class represents an instance of a specific Safe account.

```tsx
import { SafeFactory } from '@safe-global/protocol-kit'

const safeFactory = await SafeFactory.create({ ethAdapter: ethAdapterOwner1 })
```

### Deploy a Safe

Calling the `deploySafe` method will deploy the desired Safe and return a Protocol Kit initialized instance ready to be used. Check the [API Reference](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-core-sdk/tree/main/packages/protocol-kit#deploysafe) for more details on additional configuration parameters and callbacks.

```tsx
import { SafeAccountConfig } from '@safe-global/protocol-kit'

const safeAccountConfig: SafeAccountConfig = {
  owners: [
    await owner1Signer.getAddress(),
    await owner2Signer.getAddress(),
    await owner3Signer.getAddress()
  ],
  threshold: 2,
  // ... (Optional params)
}

/* This Safe is tied to owner 1 because the factory was initialized with
an adapter that had owner 1 as the signer. */
const safeSdkOwner1 = await safeFactory.deploySafe({ safeAccountConfig })

const safeAddress = await safeSdkOwner1.getAddress()

console.log('Your Safe has been deployed:')
console.log(`https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/${safeAddress}`)
console.log(`https://app.safe.global/gor:${safeAddress}`)
```

### Send ETH to the Safe

You will send some ETH to this Safe.

```tsx
const safeAddress = safeSdk.getAddress()

const safeAmount = ethers.parseUnits('0.01', 'ether').toHexString()

const transactionParameters = {
  to: safeAddress,
  value: safeAmount
}

const tx = await owner1Signer.sendTransaction(transactionParameters)

console.log('Fundraising.')
console.log(`Deposit Transaction: https://goerli.etherscan.io/tx/${tx.hash}`)
```

## Making a transaction from a Safe

The first signer will sign and propose a transaction to send 0.005 ETH out of the Safe. Then, the second signer will add their own proposal and execute the transaction since it meets the 2 of 3 thresholds.

At a high level, making a transaction from the Safe requires the following steps:

### Overview

The high-level overview of a multi-sig transaction is PCE: Propose. Confirm. Execute.

1. **First signer proposes a transaction**
   1. Create transaction: define the amount, destination, and any additional data
   2. Perform an off-chain signature of the transaction before proposing
   3. Submit the transaction and signature to the Safe Transaction Service
2. **Second signer confirms the transaction**
   1. Get pending transactions from the Safe service
   2. Perform an off-chain signature of the transaction
   3. Submit the signature to the service
3. **Anyone executes the transaction**
   1. In this example, the first signer executes the transaction
   2. Anyone can get the pending transaction from the Safe service
   3. Account executing the transaction pays the gas fee

### Create a transaction

For more details on what to include in a transaction see [Create a Transaction in the Safe Core SDK Guide](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-core-sdk/blob/main/guides/integrating-the-safe-core-sdk.md#4-create-a-transaction).

```tsx
import { MetaTransactionData } from '@safe-global/safe-core-sdk-types'

// Any address can be used. In this example you will use vitalik.eth
const destination = '0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045'
const amount = ethers.parseUnits('0.005', 'ether').toString()

const safeTransactionData: MetaTransactionData = {
  to: destination,
  data: '0x',
  value: amount
}
// Create a Safe transaction with the provided parameters
const safeTransaction = await safeSdkOwner1.createTransaction({ transactions: [safeTransactionData] })
```

### Propose the transaction

To propose a transaction to the Safe Transaction Service we need to call the `proposeTransaction` method from the API Kit instance.

For a full list and description of the properties that `proposeTransaction` accepts, see [Propose the transaction to the service](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-core-sdk/blob/main/guides/integrating-the-safe-core-sdk.md#propose-transaction) in the Safe Core SDK guide.

```tsx
// Deterministic hash based on transaction parameters
const safeTxHash = await safeSdkOwner1.getTransactionHash(safeTransaction)

// Sign transaction to verify that the transaction is coming from owner 1
const senderSignature = await safeSdkOwner1.signTransactionHash(safeTxHash)

await safeService.proposeTransaction({
  safeAddress,
  safeTransactionData: safeTransaction.data,
  safeTxHash,
  senderAddress: await owner1Signer.getAddress(),
  senderSignature: senderSignature.data,
})
```

### Get pending transactions

Recall that you created the `safeService` in [Initialize the API Kit](./#initialize-the-safe-api-kit).

```tsx
const pendingTransactions = await safeService.getPendingTransactions(safeAddress).results
```

### Confirm the transaction: Second confirmation

When owner 2 is connected to the application, the Protocol Kit should be initialized again with the existing Safe address the address of the owner 2 instead of the owner 1.

```tsx
// Assumes that the first pending transaction is the transaction you want to confirm
const transaction = pendingTransactions[0]
const safeTxHash = transaction.safeTxHash

const ethAdapterOwner2 = new EthersAdapter({
  ethers,
  signerOrProvider: owner2Signer
})

const safeSdkOwner2 = await Safe.create({
  ethAdapter: ethAdapterOwner2,
  safeAddress
})

const signature = await safeSdkOwner2.signTransactionHash(safeTxHash)
const response = await safeService.confirmTransaction(safeTxHash, signature.data)
```

### Execute the transaction

Anyone can execute the Safe transaction once it has the required number of signatures. In this example, owner 1 will execute the transaction and pay for the gas fees.

```tsx
const safeTransaction = await safeService.getTransaction(safeTxHash)
const executeTxResponse = await safeSdk.executeTransaction(safeTransaction)
const receipt = await executeTxResponse.transactionResponse?.wait()

console.log('Transaction executed:')
console.log(`https://goerli.etherscan.io/tx/${receipt.transactionHash}`)
```

### Confirm that the transaction was executed

You know that the transaction was executed if the balance in your Safe changes.

```tsx
const afterBalance = await safeSdk.getBalance()

console.log(`The final balance of the Safe: ${ethers.formatUnits(afterBalance, 'ether')} ETH`)
```

```bash
$ node index.js

Fundraising.

Initial balance of Safe: 0.01 ETH
Buying a car.
The final balance of the Safe: 0.005 ETH
```

### Conclusion

In this quickstart, you learned how to create and deploy a Safe and to propose and then execute a transaction for the Safe.
