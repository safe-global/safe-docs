# Install Safe on your chain

Safe's vision is to make every web3 account a smart account. Therefore, we prioritize teams and chains building with smart accounts, especially if they push account abstraction (for example, [ERC-4337](https://docs.safe.global/home/4337-safe) or EIP-1271 adoption) with Safe.

Safe's security is based on the contracts deployed in EVM-compatible networks. For the time being, we are not looking to extend beyond EVM.

To have the full Safe stack running on your chain network, you need to consider the following steps:


## Deploy Safe canonical contracts

**Process**

You can find detailed instructions under [Contracts Deployment](./safe-contracts-deployment.mdx).

**Cost**

The contracts are fully open source, but you have to pay gas in the new chain's native currency for contract deployment.

**Timeline**

Safe reviews registrations of canonical deployments on a two-week cadence.

## Deploy and maintain Safe\{Wallet\} and Safe\{Core\} infrastructure

**Process**

You have three options available:

1. Use the Platform-as-a-Service run by Safe Core Contributors.
2. Use the Platform-as-a-Service run by third-party integrators.
3. Self-host the infrastructure.

You can find detailed instructions under [Infrastructure Deployment](./safe-infrastructure-deployment.mdx). 

**Cost**

- Safe is fully open source but requires someone to run and maintain the [web interface](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-wallet-web) and [infrastructure](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-infrastructure/blob/main/docs/running_production.md).
- Cost is based on the individual agreement (if run by any third party, including Safe).
- Primary cost factors:
  - Deployment costs.
  - Indexing.
  - Cloud storage and monitoring services.

**Timeline**

- Based on the individual agreement with Safe or third-party integrators.
- Prioritisation for native integration ([app.safe.global](https://app.safe.global)) is primarily based on the network's smart account/account abstraction strategy (for example, is every user account a Safe under the hood beyond the usage of Safe as a multi-signature for treasury management?) and [additional metrics](https://noteforms.com/forms/request-safe-ui-and-infra-support-4weugt).
