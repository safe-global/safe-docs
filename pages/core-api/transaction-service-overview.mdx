# Safe Transaction Service API

The Safe Transaction Service API offers REST endpoints to keep track of transactions sent via Safe contracts. It also offers endpoints to send transactions to allow off-chain collecting of signatures or informing the owners about a pending transaction to be sent to the blockchain.

We also offer the [API Kit](../sdk/api-kit), a TypeScript client for the Safe Transaction Service API in the Safe\{Core\} SDK.
