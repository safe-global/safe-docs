# Safe Transaction Service API

The Safe Transaction Service offers a REST API to track transactions sent via the Safe Smart Account. It also provides endpoints to send transactions, allow off-chain collecting of signatures, or informing the owners about a pending transaction to be sent to the blockchain.

Additionally, the Safe\{Core\} SDK provides the [API Kit](../sdk/api-kit), a TypeScript client for the Safe Transaction Service API.
