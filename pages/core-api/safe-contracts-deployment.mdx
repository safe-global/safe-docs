# Safe\{Core\} contracts deployment

In this section, you will deploy the Safe\{Core\} contracts on your chain.

All Safe contract deployments on any network follow the same procedure to ensure a deterministic address for all singleton contracts (proxy-factory, mastercopy, etc.) and verify the deployment.

## Prerequisites

Open a [pull request](https://github.com/ethereum-lists/chains) to add your chain to [chainlist.org](https://chainlist.org/).

## Steps

<Steps>

### Singleton factory contract deployment

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
 You do not need to perform these tasks if your network is based on a rollup framework with Safe contracts already deployed (for example, OP Stack).
</Callout>

1. Create a new issue in the [safe-singleton-factory](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-singleton-factory/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=new_chain.yml&title=%5BNew+chain%5D%3A+) repository.
2. A bot will reply to the issue with the deployer address (`0x914...3d7`) and the amount of native token you need to send to this address.
3. Once funded, mark the checkbox on the GitHub issue.
4. The review of the issues happens every two weeks. Our team will perform the deterministic deployment of the `safe-singleton-factory` contract and publish a new npm release of [@safe-global/safe-singleton-factory](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@safe-global/safe-singleton-factory).

</Callout>

1. Clone the [safe-smart-account](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-smart-account) repository by running the following command:
    ```
    git clone --branch v1.3.0-libs.0 https://github.com/safe-global/safe-smart-account.git
    cd safe-smart-account
    ```
    
2. Get the latest version of [@safe-global/safe-singleton-factory](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@safe-global/safe-singleton-factory), by running the following command:

    ```bash
    npm i --save-dev @safe-global/safe-singleton-factory
    ```

    Ensure the latest version includes your [safe-singleton-factory deployment](#singleton-factory-contract-deployment) from before.

3. Deploy Contracts.
    
    {/* <!-- vale off --> */}
    <Tabs items={["Infura supports your chain", "Infura does not support your chain"]}>
        <Tabs.Tab>
            Create a `.env` file in the root of the repository with the following content:
            ```bash
            MNEMONIC=funded_account_on_this_network
            INFURA_KEY=your_Infura_project_API_key
            ```

            Deploy the contracts by running this command:
            ```bash
            npm run deploy-all your_chain_id
            ```
        </Tabs.Tab>
        <Tabs.Tab>
            Create a `.env` file in the root of the repository with the following content:
            ```bash
            MNEMONIC=funded_account_on_this_network
            NODE_URL=RPC_endpoint_for_your_network
            ```

            Deploy the contracts by running this command:

            ```bash
            npm run deploy-all custom
            ```
        </Tabs.Tab>
    </Tabs>
    {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

4. The script should deploy all the singleton contracts (nine contracts in total).

    Write down each address (example addresses for v1.3.0 could look like):
    ```js
    compatibility_fallback_handler: `0x017062a1dE2FE6b99BE3d9d37841FeD19F573804`
    create_call: `0xB19D6FFc2182150F8Eb585b79D4ABcd7C5640A9d`
    gnosis_safe: `0x69f4D1788e39c87893C980c06EdF4b7f686e2938`
    gnosis_safe_l2: `0xfb1bffC9d739B8D520DaF37dF666da4C687191EA`
    multi_send: `0x998739BFdAAdde7C933B942a68053933098f9EDa`
    multi_send_call_only: `0xA1dabEF33b3B82c7814B6D82A79e50F4AC44102B`
    proxy_factory: `0xC22834581EbC8527d974F8a1c97E1bEA4EF910BC`
    sign_message_lib: `0x98FFBBF51bb33A056B08ddf711f289936AafF717`
    simulate_tx_accessor: `0x727a77a074D1E6c4530e814F89E618a3298FC044`
    ```


### Record your contracts in the official registry

You must share your singleton contract deployment addresses in the official public registry.
1. Fork the [safe-deployments](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-deployments) GitHub repository.
2. Add your chain ID to each of the nine JSON files in `src/assets/<version>`. If you deployed with the singleton deployment from above, you have to mark your chain's deployment as "canonical".
For example, add this line to `gnosis_safe.json` to indicate the gnosis safe has the canonical address on your chain:
    ```json
    "<your_chain_id>": "canonical"
    ```

3. Open a pull request. Your pull request should follow this [example pull request](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-deployments/pull/679).

</Steps>

Now, you have deployed the Safe\{Core\} contracts on your chain. 

In the next step, you have to install the Safe\{Core\} infrastructure.
