# How to use API Keys

To enhance the security and reliability of your integrations, Safe is introducing **authenticated API access**. This ensures that only authorized applications and developers can interact with our services, protecting your data and the overall ecosystem.

<Callout type='error' emoji='⚠️'>
  We plan to deprecate public (unauthenticated) endpoints in the near future. We
  strongly encourage you to transition to authenticated API access now to avoid
  disruptions to your integration.
</Callout>

This guide walks you through generating an API key, making authenticated requests, and understanding rate limits, error handling, and best practices.

## Getting a Safe API Key

1. Visit the [Safe API Dashboard](https://developer.safe.global/).
2. Create an account (if you haven’t already).
3. Generate your API key in the **API Keys** section.

_The API Key is a JWT, which is set to expire after 5 years._

## Using Your API Key

To authenticate your requests, include your API key in the Authorization header. Below, there are different request examples. We use EIP3770 names for chains, so for example, for Ethereum Mainnet (eth):

        }
      )
        .then((response) => response.json())
        .then((data) => console.log(data))
        .catch((error) => console.error("Error:", error));

      const apiKit = new SafeApiKit({
        chainId: 1,

      const multisigTransactions = await apiKit.getMultisigTransactions(

      );

      console.log(multisigTransactions);

## Rate Limits and Usage Tiers

Safe API currently enforces a rate limits of 5 requests/sec. If you need higher rate limits, please reach out to us at support@safe.global for details on upgrading your tier and understanding usage quotas.

## Error Handling

If your API key is invalid or exceeds its rate limit, the API will respond with standard HTTP error codes:

- `401 Unauthorized`: Invalid or missing API key.
- `429 Too Many Requests`: Rate limit exceeded.

Please ensure your application gracefully handles these errors to prevent disruptions.

## Best Practices

- **Store keys securely**: Use environment variables or secure vaults rather than hard code values into your code.
- **Rotate keys periodically**: Regularly rotate your API keys to minimize risk.
- **Revoke compromised keys immediately**: Use the dashboard to revoke and regenerate keys as needed.
