# `createSafeClient`

This method serves as the entry point for working with the SDK starter Kit. You typically create a Safe client to begin using this package. 

This client enables developers to handle transactions and configure the Safe account. It provides an extension mechanism through an `extend` method, allowing you to easily add new methods to handle messages, Safe operations, or even your own custom functionality.

## Usage

  ```typescript   
    import { createSafeClient } from '@safe-global/sdk-starter-kit'

    // Use the safeAddress if the Safe account already exists
    const safeClient = await createSafeClient({
      provider,
      signer,
      safeAddress
    })
  ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  ```typescript 
    import { createSafeClient } from '@safe-global/sdk-starter-kit'
    import { privateKeyToAddress } from 'viem/accounts'
    
    const owner1 = privateKeyToAddress(OWNER_1_PRIVATE_KEY)
    const owner2 = privateKeyToAddress(OWNER_2_PRIVATE_KEY)
    const owner3 = privateKeyToAddress(OWNER_3_PRIVATE_KEY)

    // Use the safeOptions if the Safe account does not exist and you want to deploy a new one.
    // The resulting Safe address will be deterministic based on the owners, threshold, and saltNonce. 
    // Using the safeClient after the deployment (with the first send()) will operate as if you would use the safeAddress.
    const safeClient = await createSafeClient({
      provider: RPC_URL,
      signer: OWNER_1_PRIVATE_KEY,
      safeOptions: {
        owners: [owner1, owner2, owner3],
        threshold: THRESHOLD,
        saltNonce: SALT_NONCE
      }
    })

```

## Returns

`Promise<SafeClient>`

The returned SafeClient object provides several methods to create and execute Ethereum transactions with the Safe account, as well as to modify the Safe account configuration.

## Parameters

### `provider`

- **Type:** `Eip1193Provider | HttpTransport | SocketTransport`

The provider used to interact with the blockchain can be an [EIP-1193](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1193) compatible provider object (for example, `window.ethereum`), an HTTP URL, or a WebSocket URL.

### `signer`

- **Type:** `HexAddress | PrivateKey | PasskeyClient`

The signer used to sign transactions. It can be a hexadecimal address, a private key, or a PasskeyClient instance.
  - When using a hexadecimal address, the SafeClient will use that address in the `provider` to sign the transactions.
  - When using a private key, the SafeClient will sign transactions using the derived address from the private key.
  - When using a PasskeyClient, the SafeClient will use the PasskeyClient to sign the transactions.

### `safeAddress`

- **Type:** `HexAddress`

When using the `safeAddress` parameter, the SafeClient will use an existing Safe account. You cannot use `safeAddress` and `safeOptions` simultaneously.

### `owners`

- **Type:** `string[]`

The list of owners for the Safe account must be an array of hexadecimal addresses.

### `threshold`

- **Type:** `number`

The threshold for the Safe account must be a number between 1 and the number of owners. For a transaction to be valid, the number of collected signatures must be equal to or greater than the threshold.

### `saltNonce`

- **Type:** `string`

The salt value of the Safe account. It is a parameter in the Safe account address prediction algorithm, so changing this will generate different Safe addresses.
