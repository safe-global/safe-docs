# `createSafeClient`

This method is the entrypoint to work with the SDK Starter Kit. You normally create a Safe client to start working with this package.

## Usage

<Tabs items={["existing-safe.ts", "new-safe-one-owner.ts", "new-safe-multiple-owner.ts"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  ```typescript 
    const safeClient = await createSafeClient({
      provider,
      signer,
      safeAddress
    })
  ```
  </Tabs.Tab>

  ```typescript 
    const safeClient = await createSafeClient({

      signer,
      safeOptions: {

  ```typescript 
    import { privateKeyToAddress } from 'viem/accounts'
    
    const owner1 = privateKeyToAddress(OWNER_1_PRIVATE_KEY)
    const owner2 = privateKeyToAddress(OWNER_2_PRIVATE_KEY)
    const owner3 = privateKeyToAddress(OWNER_3_PRIVATE_KEY)

    const safeClient = await createSafeClient({
      provider: RPC_URL,
      signer: OWNER_1_PRIVATE_KEY,
      safeOptions: {
        owners: [owner1, owner2, owner3],
        threshold: THRESHOLD,
        saltNonce: SALT_NONCE
      }

## Returns

`Promise<SafeClient>`

A SafeClient instance with several methods enabling the creations and execution of ethereum transactions with the Safe account and changing the Safe account configuration.

## Parameters

### `provider`

- **Type:** `Eip1193Provider | HttpTransport | SocketTransport`

The provider to use to interact with the blockchain. It can be an EIP-1193 compatibe provider object (e.g window.ethereum), an HTTP url, or a WebSocket url.

### `signer`

- **Type:** `HexAddress | PrivateKey | PasskeyClient`

The signer to use to sign transactions. It can be a hex address, a private key, or a PasskeyClient instance.
When using an Hex address, the SafeClient will use that address in the `provider` to sign the transactions.
When using a PrivateKey, the SafeClient will sign the transactions using th derived address from the private key.
When using a PasskeyClient, the SafeClient will use the PasskeyClient to sign the transactions.

### `safeAddress`

- **Type:** `HexAddress`

When usign the `safeAddress` parameter, the SafeClient will use an existing Safe account. You cannot use `safeAddress` and `safeOptions` at once.

### `owners`

- **Type:** `string[]`

The list of owners of the Safe account. It must be an array of hex addresses.

### `threshold`

- **Type:** `number`

The threshold of the Safe account. It must be a number between 1 and the number of owners and in order for a transactions to be valid, the number of collected signatures must be equal or greater than the threshold.

### `saltNonce`

- **Type:** `string`

The salt nonce of the Safe account. It is a parameter in the Safe account address prediction algorithm so if you change this, differente Safe addresses will be generated.
