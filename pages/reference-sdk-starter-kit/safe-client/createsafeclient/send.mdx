# `send`

The `send` method is used to send transactions from your Safe account. It covers various transaction flows that you would typically need to implement yourself if you're using a more advanced kit, such as the `protocol-kit` in conjunction with the `api-kit`. You can send an array to transactions (to, value, data) that we will convert to a transaction batch.

We can distinguish two main cases when using the `send` method:

If the Safe account is already deployed (you are using `safeAddress` or the `safeOptions` counterfactual address prediction derives an existing Safe account):

  - In the case the Safe is a multisig account (more than one owner and threshold greater than 1), the `send` method will propose the transaction to our Transaction Service. The transaction is not sent to the blockchain immediately, but is stored in our services. This is because you need more signatures than just the one for the `signer` used to create the client.
  - In the case the Safe is a single-owner account (threshold equal to 1), the transaction is sent directly to the blockchain without being stored in our services, as it is not necessary.

If the Safe account has not yet been deployed (you are using `safeOptions` and the counterfactual address prediction results in a non-existing Safe account):

  - In the case the Safe is a multisig account, the `send` method will propose the transaction to our Transaction Service, just as in the previous case. However, the Safe account will be deployed using the funds in the current `signer` account.
  - In the case the Safe is a single-owner account, the transaction is sent directly to the blockchain without being stored in our services. The Safe account will be deployed using the funds in the current `signer` account.

      const txResult = await safeClient.send({

    ```typescript 
      import { createSafeClient } from '@safe-global/sdk-starter-kit'

      const safeClient = await createSafeClient({
        provider,  
        signer,
        safeAddress
      })
    ```

## Returns

`SafeClientResult`

An object with the result of the send transaction operation.

## Parameters

### `transactions`

- **Type:** `TransactionBase[]`

Here is the improved text:

An array of transactions to be sent. If there are multiple transactions, they will be sent in the same batch. Each transaction is represented by an object containing the recipient address (to), the value (value) to be sent, and any additional data (data) as in a regular Ethereum transaction.

    1.	`to`: The address of the recipient of the transaction.
    2.	`value`: The amount of ether (in wei) being transferred from the sender to the recipient. If you are invoking a smart contract without sending any ether, this value can be zero.
    3.	`data`: This field carries additional information sent with the transaction. For standard ether transfers between addresses, this field is usually empty. However, when interacting with smart contracts, this field contains the encoded function call and parameters.

### `from` (optional)

- **Type:** `string`

The sender's address for the transaction.

### `gasLimit` (optional)

- **Type:** `stringnumber | string | bigint`

The maximum amount of gas the transaction can use. If the transaction requires more gas than the limit, it will fail.

### `gasPrice` (optional)

- **Type:** `number | string`

The price in wei that the sender is willing to pay for each unit of gas.

### `maxFeePerGas` (optional)

- **Type:** `number | string`

The maximum fee per gas the sender is willing to pay.

### `maxPriorityFeePerGas` (optional)

- **Type:** `number | string`

The maximum priority fee per gas the sender is willing to pay.

### `nonce` (optional)

- **Type:** `number | string`

The `nonce` refers to a unique number used in a transaction to prevent the same transaction from being processed more than once.
