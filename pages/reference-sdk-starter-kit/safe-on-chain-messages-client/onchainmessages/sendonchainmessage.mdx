# `sendOnChainMessage`

Creates and sends a message as a regular transaction using the SignMessageLib contract. The message can be a string or an EIP712TypedData object.

As this method creates a new transaction you can confirm it using the safeTxHash and the confirm() method and retrieve the pending transactions using the getPendingTransactions() method from the general client

## Usage

{/* <!-- vale off --> */}

<Tabs items={["send.ts", "setup.ts"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```typescript 
      const message = "I am the owner of this Safe"

      const messageResult = await safeMessageClient.sendOnChainMessage({ message })
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>  
    ```typescript 
      import { onChainMessages } from '@safe-global/sdk-starter-kit'
      
      const safeClient = await createSafeClient({
        provider,  
        signer,
        safeAddress
      })

        const safeMessageClient = safeClient.extend(onChainMessages())
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

{/* <!-- vale on --> */}

## Returns

`SafeClientResult`

An object with the result of the send operation.

## Parameters

### `transactions`

- **Type:** `TransactionBase[]`

An array of transactions to be sent. If more than one the transactions will be sent in the same batch. Each transaction is represented by an to, value, data object as any regular Ethereum transaction.

	1.	`to`: This is the address of the recipient of the transaction.
	2.	`value`: This specifies the amount of ether (in wei) being transferred from the sender to the recipient. If you are invoking a smart contract without sending any ether, this value can be zero.
	3.	`data`: This field contains extra information sent along with the transaction. For standard ether transfers between addresses, this field is typically empty. However, when interacting with smart contracts, this field carries the encoded function call and parameters.

### `from` (optional)

- **Type:** `string`

The address of the sender of the transaction.

### `gasLimit` (optional)

- **Type:** `stringnumber | string | bigint`

The maximum amount of gas that the transaction is allowed to use. If the transaction requires more gas than the gas limit, the transaction will fail.

### `gasPrice` (optional)

- **Type:** `number | string`

The price of gas in wei that the sender is willing to pay for each unit of gas.

### `maxFeePerGas` (optional)

- **Type:** `number | string`

The maximum fee per gas the sender is willing to pay.

### `maxPriorityFeePerGas` (optional)

- **Type:** `number | string`

The maximum priority fee per gas the sender is willing to pay.

### `nonce` (optional)

- **Type:** `number | string`

The nonce of the transaction.
