# `sendSafeOperation`

This method allows you to send SafeOperations (User Operations with some additional Safe parameters) from a group of transactions and will convert your transactions into a batch.

Notice the usage of `transactions` instead of User Operations. The `sendSafeOperation` method internally converts those transactions into a batch and creates the User Operation with the Safe `initCode` to be deployed if necessary.

- If the Safe account threshold > 1, it will save the SafeOperation for later using the Transaction Service. You must confirm the SafeOperation with other owners.
- If the Safe account threshold is 1, the SafeOperation can be submitted to the bundler so it will execute immediately.

In any case, if the Safe account is not deployed yet, sending it to the bundler will deploy it before executing the transactions. You need to ensure you have enough funds in the Safe address (deployed or counterfactual) or if you are sponsoring it in the paymaster contract.

    ```typescript

      const safeOperationsClient = await safeClient.extend(
        safeOperations({ bundlerUrl }, { isSponsored, paymasterUrl })
      )
      
      const transactions = [{
        to: '0x...',
        value: '0',
        data '0x...',
      }, {
        to: '0x...',
        value: '0',
        data '0x...',
      }]

      const safeOperationResult = await safeOperationsClient.sendSafeOperation({
        transactions,
        validAfter: Number(timestamp - 60_000n),
        validUntil: Number(timestamp + 60_000n)
      })
    ```

## Returns

`SafeClientResult`

An object with the result of the send Safe Operation.

## Parameters

### `transactions`

- **Type:** `TransactionBase[]`

An array of transactions to be batched and sent to the bundler. Each transaction is represented by an to, value, data object as any regular Ethereum transaction.

    1.	`to`: This is the address of the recipient of the transaction.
    2.	`value`: This specifies the amount of ether (in wei) being transferred from the sender to the recipient. If you are invoking a smart contract without sending any ether, this value can be zero.
    3.	`data`: This field contains extra information sent along with the transaction. For standard ether transfers between addresses, this field is typically empty. However, when interacting with smart contracts, this field carries the encoded function call and parameters.

### `amountToApprove` (optional)

- **Type:** `bigint`

The amount to approve for the SafeOperation

### `validUntil` (optional)

- **Type:** `number`

The `validUntil` timestamp for the SafeOperation

### `validAfter` (optional)

- **Type:** `number`

The `validAfter` timestamp for the SafeOperation

### `feeEstimator` (optional)

- **Type:** `IFeeEstimator`

An object implementing the IFeeEstimator interface to estimate the fee for the SafeOperation

```typescript
IFeeEstimator {
    setupEstimation?: EstimateFeeFunction;
    adjustEstimation?: EstimateFeeFunction;
    getPaymasterEstimation?: EstimateSponsoredFeeFunction;
}
```

This methods are going to be called as hooks at different stages of the SafeOperation gas estimation:

- `setupEstimation`: Called before calling the standard `eth_estimateUserOperationGas`
- `adjustEstimation`: Called after calling the standard `eth_estimateUserOperationGas`
- `getPaymasterEstimation`: Called if the operation it's being sponsored to adjust the `paymasterAndData` property
