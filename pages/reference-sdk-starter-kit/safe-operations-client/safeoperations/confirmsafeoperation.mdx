# `confirmSafeOperation`

Confirms the stored safeOperation. Remember when using `sendSafeOperation` if the number of signatures is not enough then the operations it's being stored using Safe services so you need to confirm it with other Safe owners.

When enough signatures are collected the operation will be sent to the bundler to be executed.

## Usage

<Tabs items={["confirm-safe-operation.ts", "setup.ts"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  ```typescript 
    import { safeOperations } from '@safe-global/sdk-starter-kit'

    const safeOperationsClient = await safeClient.extend(
      safeOperations({ bundlerUrl }, { isSponsored, paymasterUrl })
    )

    const safeOperationHash = '0x...'
    const safeOperationResult = await safeClient.confirmSafeOperation({ 
      safeOperationHash
    })
  ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  ```typescript 
      import { createSafeClient } from '@safe-global/sdk-starter-kit'

      const safeClient = await createSafeClient({
        provider,  
        signer,
        safeAddress
      })
  ```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

{/* <!-- vale on --> */}

## Returns

`SafeClientResult`

An object with the result of the send operation.

## Parameters

### `safeTxHash`

- **Type:** `string`

The transaction hash is a unique identifier for the transaction, but it does not represent the actual Ethereum transaction hash. This hash is computed and stored in the Transaction Service, as the transaction has not been executed yet.

To obtain the hash, an application that attempts to confirm transactions can use the `getPendingTransactions()` method to retrieve the various pending transactions and their hashes.

```typescript
const safeTxHashToSearch = '0x...'
const pendingTransactions = await safeClient.getPendingTransactions()

for (const transaction of pendingTransactions.results) {
  if (transaction.safeTxHash !== safeTxHashToSearch) {
    return
  }

  const txResult = await safeClient.confirm({ safeTxHash: transaction.safeTxHash })
}
