# Reference

The [SDK starter Kit](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-core-sdk/tree/main/packages/sdk-starter-kit) should be the entrypoint to work with Safe Smart Accounts. It provides an easy way to work with Transactions, Messages (off-chain and on-chain), and Safe operations encapsulating a lot of logic that in other case the developer should do in the target applications and leveraging the Safe contracts and Services as the Transaction Service.

This kit uses our other kits to implement the most used flows the developers use to implement in their applications.
