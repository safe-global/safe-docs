# Starter Kit Reference

The [Starter Kit](../sdk/starter-kit) is the starting point for integrating the Safe smart account in the front-end, as it provides the most simplified way to handle the Safe transaction flow in its different forms:

- User operations
- Multi-signature transactions
- Off-chain and on-chain messages

## Install dependencies
