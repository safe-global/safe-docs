# Reference

The [Starter Kit](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-core-sdk/tree/main/packages/sdk-starter-kit) should be the entry point for working with Safe Smart Accounts. It provides an easy way to handle the Safe account main types:

  - Transactions
  - Off-chain and on-chain messages
  - Safe operations

The kit encapsulates significant logic that developers would otherwise need to implement in their target applications. It leverages the Safe contracts and services, such as the Transaction Service, by storing the types of operations requiring more signatures to be executed on the blockchain.

This kit uses our other kits to implement the most commonly used flows that developers need to implement in their applications.
