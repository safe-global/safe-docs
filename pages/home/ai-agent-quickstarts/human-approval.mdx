# Human approval for Agent actions

This page describes a setup, where an autonomous agent proposes transactions, and one or more human signers approve and execute the transaction.

This setup benefits from increased security, as the Smart Account can not be compromised by convincing the agent to execute a malicious transaction.

On the other hand, it can take minutes or hours to collect the necessary approvals, which reduces the agility of this setup.

## Setup the Smart Account

For this setup, we recommend a 2-out-of-3, 3-out-of-5, or 5-out-of-7 threshold.
The important considerations are:

* The AI agent should be one signer
* The threshold should be two more, so at least one human approval is required
* The amount of signers should be higher than the threshold to make sure the Safe Smart Account is functional when one key is lost

Here is an example setup:

```typescript
import { createSafeClient } from '@safe-global/sdk-starter-kit'

const AGENT_ADDRESS = // ...
const AGENT_PRIVATE_KEY = // ...
const HUMAN_SIGNER_1_ADDRESS = // ...
const HUMAN_SIGNER_2_ADDRESS = // ...
const RPC_URL = 'https://rpc.ankr.com/eth_sepolia'

const safeClient = await createSafeClient({
  provider: RPC_URL,
  signer: AGENT_PRIVATE_KEY,
  safeOptions: {
    owners: [AGENT_ADDRESS, HUMAN_SIGNER_1_ADDRESS, HUMAN_SIGNER_2_ADDRESS],
    threshold: 2
  }
})
```

Here, the AI agent creates the Safe Smart Account and adds two human signers for a 2-out-of-3 setup.

## Approve and execute the transactions

The transactions will now show up in the transaction interface of the [Safe Wallet](https://app.safe.global).
The human signers now have to connect their MetaMask, and approve and/or execute the transactions with a click.
