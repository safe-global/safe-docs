## Multi-agent setup

In this setup, the Safe Smart Account is managed by multiple agents.
When one agent proposes a transaction, it needs to be approved by at least one other agent.
We recommend to have human signers as well, so that the Safe Smart Account is functional even without the AI agents.

Here is an example with a 2-out-of-4 setup:

```typescript
import { createSafeClient } from '@safe-global/sdk-starter-kit'

const AGENT_1_ADDRESS = // ...
const AGENT_1_PRIVATE_KEY = // ...
const AGENT_2_ADDRESS = // ...
const HUMAN_SIGNER_1_ADDRESS = // ...
const HUMAN_SIGNER_2_ADDRESS = // ...
const RPC_URL = 'https://rpc.ankr.com/eth_sepolia'

const safeClient = await createSafeClient({
  provider: RPC_URL,
  signer: AGENT_1_PRIVATE_KEY,
  safeOptions: {
    owners: [AGENT_1_ADDRESS, AGENT_2_ADDRESS, HUMAN_SIGNER_1_ADDRESS, HUMAN_SIGNER_2_ADDRESS],
    threshold: 2
  }
})
```

This setup is similar to the previous one.
The AI agents can make autonomous decisions, and the human signers can do so, too.
