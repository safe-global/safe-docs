# Multi-Agent Setup

In this guide, you'll learn how to set up and manage a Safe Smart Account with multiple agents.
This setup ensures that every transaction proposed by one agent is approved by at least one other agent.
To maintain full functionality, we recommend including human signers in addition to the AI agents. 

Below, we demonstrate a 2-out-of-4 setup as an example.

# Two Agents Propose, Check, and Execute Transactions

<Steps>

### Setup Safe Smart Account with agent one

You will use the Safe [Protocol Kit](./../../sdk/protocol-kit.mdx).

```typescript
import Safe from '@safe-global/protocol-kit'

const AGENT_1_ADDRESS = // ...
const AGENT_1_PRIVATE_KEY = // ...
const AGENT_2_ADDRESS = // ...
const HUMAN_SIGNER_1_ADDRESS = // ...
const HUMAN_SIGNER_2_ADDRESS = // ...
const RPC_URL = 'https://rpc.ankr.com/eth_sepolia'

const newSafe = await Safe.init({
  provider: RPC_URL,
  signer: AGENT_1_PRIVATE_KEY,
  safeOptions: {
    owners: [AGENT_1_ADDRESS, AGENT_2_ADDRESS, HUMAN_SIGNER_1_ADDRESS, HUMAN_SIGNER_2_ADDRESS],
    threshold: 2
  }
})
```
The Smart Account is now created with a fixed address. If the account has not been deployed yet, it will automatically deploy when the first transaction is executed.

### Propose a Transaction with Agent One

Agent One can now propose transactions. We recommend sending these transactions to the [Safe Transaction Service](./../../../core-api/transaction-service-overview.mdx). Using this service provides several benefits:
- It allows Agent Two to easily receive, sign, and execute the transaction.
- Transactions appear in the Safe Wallet interface, where human signers can review, approve, and execute them.

You can use the [Api Kit](./../../sdk/api-kit.mdx) to propose transactions to the Safe Transaction Service.

Here's an example of how Agent One can propose a simple transaction to the zero address:


```typescript
import SafeApiKit from '@safe-global/api-kit'

const apiKit = new SafeApiKit({
  chainId: 11155111n
})

const tx = await newSafe.createTransaction({
  transactions: [
    {
      to: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000',
      data: '0x',
      value: '0'
    }
  ]
})

// Every transaction has a Safe (Smart Account) Transaction Hash different than the final transaction hash
const safeTxHash = await newSafe.getTransactionHash(tx)
// The AI agent signs this Safe (Smart Account) Transaction Hash
const signature = await newSafe.signHash(safeTxHash)

// Now the transaction with the signature is sent to the Transaction Service with the Api Kit:
await apiKit.proposeTransaction({
  safeAddress: safeAddress,
  safeTransactionData: tx.data,
  safeTxHash,
  senderSignature: signature.data,
  senderAddress: AGENT_ADDRESS
})
```

### Receive and sign transaction with agent two

In the next step, the second AI agent needs to receive the transaction and, after performing any necessary checks, sign and execute it.

The second AI agent will run on its own machine, so you would have to initialize the Safe instance with the Smart Account's address.


```typescript
const SAFE_ADDRESS = '0x...' // The address of the Smart Account from step one

// Initialize the Safe object with the same address, but a different signer
const existingSafe = await Safe.init({
  provider: RPC_URL,
  signer: AGENT_2_PRIVATE_KEY,
  safeAddress: SAFE_ADDRESS
})

// Get pending transactions that need a signature
const pendingTransactions = await apiKit.getPendingTransactions(SAFE_ADDRESS)
// We assume there is only one pending transaction
const transaction = pendingTransactions.results[0]

// Here, your AI agent could check this transaction.

// As only one more signater is required, AI agent two can execute the transaction:
existingSafe.executeTransaction(transaction)
```
</Steps>


## Next steps
Your AI agents can make autonomous decisions, and the human signers can do so, too.
We are exited to see what you will build.
