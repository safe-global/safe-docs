## Agent has a whitelist of allowed actions

This setup provides a scoped set of actions to an agent.

This provides fast and autonomous freedom to an agent, while ensuring that the agent cannot act outside of the scoped actions.

Typically, agents are allowed to interact with one or more protocols or exchange tokens on one or more liquidity pools.
