# Basic setup to equip your AI agent with a Smart Account

Get started with Safe AI integration in just a few steps.

This guide will help you set up a Safe Smart Account with the AI agent as the only signer.
This 1-out-of-1 signer setup is discouraged by Safe, as it is not secure.
However, many projects choose this setup for simplicity.

## Installation

First, add the Safe SDK to your project:

```bash
pnpm add @safe-global/sdk-starter-kit
```

## Creating a Safe Smart Account for your AI agent

When your AI agent is ready to interact with the blockchain, you can create a Safe Smart Account for it.

```typescript
import { createSafeClient } from '@safe-global/sdk-starter-kit'

const SIGNER_ADDRESS = // ...
const SIGNER_PRIVATE_KEY = // ...
const RPC_URL = 'https://rpc.ankr.com/eth_sepolia'

const safeClient = await createSafeClient({
  provider: RPC_URL,
  signer: SIGNER_PRIVATE_KEY,
  safeOptions: {
    owners: [SIGNER_ADDRESS],
    threshold: 1
  }
})
```

This creates a Safe Smart Account, but the actual smart contract will be deployed when you send the first transaction.
