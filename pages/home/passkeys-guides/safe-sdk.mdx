# Passkeys with the Safe\{Core\} SDK

This guide will teach you how to create and execute multiple Safe transactions grouped in a batch from a Safe Smart Account that uses a passkey as an owner. To have a good user experience, we will use an [ERC-4337 compatible Safe](../4337-guides/safe-sdk.mdx) with sponsored transactions using Pimlico infrastructure. During this guide, we will create a new passkey, add it to the Safe as an owner, and use it to sign the user operations.

This guide uses [Pimlico](https://pimlico.io) as the service provider, but any other provider compatible with the ERC-4337 can be used.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).
- A [Pimlico account](https://dashboard.pimlico.io) and an API key.
- Passkeys feature is available only in [secure contexts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts) (HTTPS), in some or all [supporting browsers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Authentication_API#browser_compatibility).

## Install dependencies

```bash
yarn add @safe-global/relay-kit

```

{/* <!-- vale on --> */}

## Steps

<Steps>

  ### Imports

  Here are all the necessary imports for the script we implement in this guide.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  import { Safe4337Pack } from '@safe-global/relay-kit'
  import { PasskeyArgType } from '@safe-global/protocol-kit'
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  ### Create a passkey

  Firstly, we need to generate a passkey credential using the WebAuthn API in a supporting browser environment.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  const RP_NAME = 'Safe Smart Account'
  const USER_DISPLAY_NAME = 'User display name'
  const USER_NAME = 'User name'

  const passkeyCredential = await navigator.credentials.create({
    publicKey: {
      pubKeyCredParams: [
        {
          alg: -7,
          type: 'public-key'
        }
      ],
      challenge: crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(32)),
      rp: {
        name: RP_NAME
      },
      user: {
        displayName: USER_DISPLAY_NAME,
        id: crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(32)),
        name: USER_NAME
      },
      timeout: 60_000,
      attestation: 'none',
    },
  })
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  After generating the `passkeyCredential` object, we need to create a new object with the `PasskeyArgType` type that will contain the `rawId` and the `coordinates` information.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  if (!passkeyCredential) {
    throw Error("Passkey creation failed: No credential was returned.");
  }

  const passkey = await extractPasskeyData(passkeyCredential);
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  At this point, it's critical to securely store the information in the `passkey` object in a persistent service. Losing access to this data will result in the user being unable to access their passkey and, therefore, their Safe Smart Account.

  ### Initialize the Safe4337Pack

  Once the passkey is created and secured, we can use the `Safe4337Pack` class exported from the Relay Kit to create, sign, and submit Safe user operations.

  To instantiate this class, the static `init()` method allows connecting existing Safe accounts (as long as they have the `Safe4337Module` enabled) or setting a custom configuration to deploy a new Safe account at the time where the first Safe transaction is submitted. For this guide, we will deploy a new Safe account, configure the paymaster options to get all the transactions sponsored and connect our passkey to add it as the only owner.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  const PIMLICO_API_KEY = // ...
  const RPC_URL = 'https://rpc.ankr.com/eth_sepolia'

  const safe4337Pack = await Safe4337Pack.init({
    provider: RPC_URL,
    rpcUrl: RPC_URL,
    signer: passkey,
    bundlerUrl: `https://api.pimlico.io/v1/sepolia/rpc?apikey=${PIMLICO_API_KEY}`,
    paymasterOptions: {
      isSponsored: true,
      paymasterUrl: `https://api.pimlico.io/v2/sepolia/rpc?apikey=${PIMLICO_API_KEY}`,
      paymasterAddress: '0x...',
      paymasterTokenAddress: '0x...',
      sponsorshipPolicyId // Optional value to set the sponsorship policy id from Pimlico
    },
    options: {
      owners: [],
      threshold: 1
    }
  })
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  ### Create a user operation

  To create a Safe user operation, use the `createTransaction()` method, which takes the array of transactions to execute and returns a `SafeOperation` object.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  // Define the transactions to execute
  const transaction1 = { to, data, value }
  const transaction2 = { to, data, value }

  // Build the transaction array
  const transactions = [transaction1, transaction2]

  // Create the SafeOperation with all the transactions
  const safeOperation = await safe4337Pack.createTransaction({ transactions })
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  The `safeOperation` object has the `data` and `signatures` properties, which contain all the information about the transaction batch and the signatures of the Safe owners, respectively.

  ### Sign a user operation

  Before sending the user operation to the bundler, the `safeOperation` object must be signed with the connected passkey. The user is now requested to authenticate with the associated device and sign in with a biometric sensor, PIN, or gesture.

  The `signSafeOperation()` method, which receives a `SafeOperation` object, generates a signature that will be checked when the `Safe4337Module` validates the user operation.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  const signedSafeOperation = await safe4337Pack.signSafeOperation(
    safeTransaction
  )
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  ### Submit the user operation

  Once the `safeOperation` object is signed with the passkey, we can call the `executeTransaction()` method to submit the user operation to the bundler.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  const userOperationHash = await safe4337Pack.executeTransaction({
    executable: signedSafeOperation
  })
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  ### Check the transaction status

  To check the transaction status, we can use the `getTransactionReceipt()` method, which returns the transaction receipt after it's executed.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  let userOperationReceipt = null

  while (!userOperationReceipt) {
    // Wait 2 seconds before checking the status again
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 2000))
    userOperationReceipt = await safe4337Pack.getUserOperationReceipt(
      userOperationHash
    )
  }
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  In addition, we can use the `getUserOperationByHash()` method with the returned hash to retrieve the user operation object we sent to the bundler.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  const userOperationPayload = await safe4337Pack.getUserOperationByHash(
    userOperationHash
  )
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

</Steps>
