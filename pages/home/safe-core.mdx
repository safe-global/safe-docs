# Safe\{Core\}

[Safe\{Core\}](https://safe.global/core) is an open-source and modular [Account Abstraction](../glossary.md#account-abstraction) stack with flexible developer experience. It is the essential tooling and infrastructure for integrating the Safe Smart Account into any digital platform, ensuring a tested core with flexible and secure capabilities for innovative applications.

## Why build on Safe\{Core\}?

Safe secures an [extensive amount of assets](https://dune.com/safe). It has been thoroughly [audited](../advanced/smart-account-audits.md) and tested since 2018, and it has become the default wallet of choice for many, including DAOs, web3 native companies, and individuals like Vitalik Buterin, who trust Safe with their own assets. In addition, over [200 projects](https://safe.global/ecosystem) are currently building on top of Safe, and it is expected that this number will only continue to grow.

With Safe\{Core\}, we are putting a modular stack in the hands of developers to build the next generation of account abstraction wallets and solutions.

We have partnered with the best in the business to improve UX capabilities for authentication, relaying, and on-ramping as part of Safe\{Core\} SDK kits. Over time, we will introduce new integrations that will add more functionality and UX benefits for developers and end users, making the bridge between web2 and web3 even more seamless.

## Our stack

The Safe\{Core\} stack is categorized into three distinct groups:
