# AI agent swaps on CoW Swap

CoW swap ensures best prices and fastest execution and minimizes MEV.

You can find a working code example to run locally in our [AI agent with Safe Smart Account CoW Swap example repository](https://github.com/5afe/safe-cowswap).

Here is a quick guide to get you up and running:

## Requirements

- A deployed Safe Smart Account
- The AI agent is a signer on the Safe
- This example assumes, that the threshold of the Safe Smart Account is one, so the AI agent can sign autonomously.
If you require more signatures, you have to collect those signatures programmatically of with the [Safe Wallet](https://app.safe.global/).

## Let your AI agent send an intent 

<Steps>
### Setup the Safe Smart Account 

Your Safe Smart Account should be deployed.
Now, initialize an instance with the [Protocol Kit](./../../sdk/protocol-kit.mdx):

```typescript
import Safe from "@safe-global/protocol-kit";

const preExistingSafe = await Safe.init({
  provider: RPC_URL,
  signer: AGENT_PRIVATE_KEY,
  safeAddress: SAFE_ADDRESS,
});
```

### Send swap intent

Now, you can use the CoW Swap SDK to assemble a transaction that you can sign and execute with your Safe Smart Account.
The swap will then be executed.

Please be aware that the CoW Swap's SDK uses Ethers, while Safe's SDK use viem.
You will see some warnings in the logs, but the code works nonetheless.

In this example, we buy COW and pay with WETH.

```typescript
import {
  SwapAdvancedSettings,
  TradeParameters,
  TradingSdk,
  SupportedChainId,
  OrderKind,
  SigningScheme,
} from "@cowprotocol/cow-sdk";
import { VoidSigner } from "@ethersproject/abstract-signer";
import { JsonRpcProvider } from "@ethersproject/providers";

const traderParams = {
  chainId: SupportedChainId.SEPOLIA,
  signer: new VoidSigner(
    smartContractWalletAddress: SAFE_ADDRESS,
    new JsonRpcProvider("https://sepolia.gateway.tenderly.co")
  ),
  appCode: "awesome-app",
};

const cowSdk = new TradingSdk(traderParams, { logs: false });

const parameters: TradeParameters = {
  kind: OrderKind.SELL,
  sellToken: WETH_ADDRESS,
  sellTokenDecimals: 18,
  buyToken: COW_ADDRESS,
  buyTokenDecimals: 18,
  amount: INPUT_AMOUNT,
};

const advancedParameters: SwapAdvancedSettings = {
  quoteRequest: {
  // Specify the signing scheme
  signingScheme: SigningScheme.PRESIGN,
  },
};

const orderId = await cowSdk.postSwapOrder(parameters, advancedParameters);

console.log(`Order ID: [${orderId}]`);

const preSignTransaction = await cowSdk.getPreSignTransaction({
  orderId,
  account: smartContractWalletAddress,
});

const customChain = defineChain({
  ...sepolia,
  name: "custom chain",
  transport: http(RPC_URL),
});

const publicClient = createPublicClient({
  chain: customChain,
  transport: http(RPC_URL),
});

const safePreSignTx: MetaTransactionData = {
  to: preSignTransaction.to,
  value: preSignTransaction.value,
  data: preSignTransaction.data,
  operation: OperationType.Call,
};

const safeTx = await preExistingSafe.createTransaction({
  transactions: [safePreSignTx],
  onlyCalls: true,
});

// You might need to collect more signatures here

const txResponse = await preExistingSafe.executeTransaction(safeTx);
console.log(`Sent tx hash: [${txResponse.hash}]`);
console.log("Waiting for the tx to be mined");
await publicClient.waitForTransactionReceipt({
  hash: txResponse.hash as `0x${string}`,
});
```

</Steps>

## Next steps

Now, where your AI agent can execute trades autonomously, you are free to use this power as you like.
You can find more specific information in the [CoW Swap Trading SDK docs](https://github.com/cowprotocol/cow-sdk/tree/main/src/trading#readme).
