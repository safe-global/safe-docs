# What is Safe?

The landscape of digital assets has rapidly evolved. However, the vision has always been clear: to move from merely reading and writing in the digital realm to fully owning our digital identities, financial assets, digital art, and more. At [Safe](https://safe.global), we pursue a future where everyone has complete control and flexibility over their digital possessions. A promise that web2 failed to deliver.

While [externally-owned accounts](../../glossary.md#externally-owned-account) have been the cornerstone of digital assets management thus far, they have a lot of limitations and fall short in today's needs to onboard mainstream users. Not only are seed phrases cumbersome to secure, but the lack of flexibility and the limited security of EOAs hinder our progress toward actual digital ownership.

<Callout type='info'>
  [Safe](https://safe.global) is at the forefront of modular [smart account](../../glossary.md#smart-account) infrastructure, paving the way for developers to create various applications and wallets. Safe brings digital ownership of accounts to everyone by building universal and open contract standards for the custody of digital assets, data, and identity.

Our goal is to establish smart accounts as the default method for interacting in the web3 space, and our approach to making this a reality has developed across two primary areas of focus:
