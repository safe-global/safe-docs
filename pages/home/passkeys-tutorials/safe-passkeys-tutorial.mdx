# How to build an app with Safe and passkeys

<Callout type='warning' emoji='⚠️'>
  Passkeys support is still under audit and should not be used in production environments. Please consider this tutorial and all the code examples in it a developer preview. Compatibility with passkeys is only available when using `@safe-global/protocol-kit@4.1.0-alpha.1` and `@safe-global/relay-kit@3.1.0-alpha.1` in Sepolia.
</Callout>

An increasing number of applications rely on passkeys to authenticate users securely and with little friction. Security and user-friendliness are crucial to making web3 a reality for the next billion users.
Being able to unlock a Safe Smart Account with your fingerprints or Face ID, sending transactions without worrying about third-party wallet interfaces, phishing attempts, or securing seed phrases will bring new forms of ownership to the connected world.
Today, we'll learn how to make this a reality using [Safe\{Core\} SDK](../../sdk/overview.mdx), [Pimlico](https://www.pimlico.io/), and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs).

This tutorial will demonstrate creating a web app for using [passkeys](../passkeys-overview.mdx) in your Safe. This app will allow you to:
- Create a new passkey secured by the user's device.
- Deploy a new Safe on Ethereum Sepolia for free.
- Sign a transaction to mint an NFT using the previously created passkey.

## **What you'll need**

**Prerequisite knowledge:** You will need some basic experience with [React](https://react.dev/learn), Next.js, and [ERC-4337](../4337-overview).

Before progressing with the tutorial, please make sure you have:

- Downloaded and installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation).
- Created an API key from [Pimlico](https://www.pimlico.io/).

**Note:** If you wish to follow along using the completed project, you can [check out the GitHub repository](https://github.com/5afe/safe-passkeys-tutorial) for this tutorial.

## 1. Setup a Next.js application

Initialize a new Next.js app using pnpm with the following command:

```bash
pnpm create next-app
```

When prompted by the CLI:

- Select `yes` to TypeScript, ESLint, and App router.
- Select `no` to all other questions (Tailwind, `src` directory, and import aliases).

### Install dependencies

For this project, we'll use the [Relay Kit](../../sdk/relay-kit.mdx) and [Protocol Kit](../../sdk/protocol-kit.mdx) from the Safe\{Core\} SDK to set up a Safe, sponsor a transaction, and use [viem](https://www.npmjs.com/package/viem).

Run the following command to add all these dependencies to the project:

```bash
pnpm add @safe-global/protocol-kit@4.1.0-alpha.1 @safe-global/relay-kit@3.1.0-alpha.1 viem
```

Now, create a file named `.env.local` at the root of your project, and add your Pimlico API key to it:

```bash
echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_PIMLICO_API_KEY='your_pimlico_api_key_goes_here'" > .env.local
```

### Run the development server

Run the local development server with the following command:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Go to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to see the default Next.js application.

## 2. Add project constants and utilities

Create a `lib` folder at the project root and add a file `constants.ts` containing common constants used throughout the project:

```bash
mkdir lib
cd lib
touch constants.ts
```

Add the following code to the `constants.ts` file:

```tsx
// from ../../../examples/passkeys/lib/constants.ts
```

## 3. Add passkeys functionality

In the `lib` folder, create a file called `passkeys.ts`:

```bash
touch passkeys.ts
```

This file will contain all the logic required to operate passkey:

- Create and recover them using the user's device.
- Store and retrieve them from/to the local storage.

**Note:** You can also store the passkeys on a remote database or the user's device.

```tsx
// from ../../../examples/passkeys/lib/passkeys.ts
```

In this file, we have four functions:

- `createPasskey`, which helps create a new passkey.
- `storePasskeyInLocalStorage`, which helps store it in the browser's local storage.
- `loadPasskeysFromLocalStorage`, which helps load a passkey from local storage.
- `getPublicKeyFromLocalStorage`, which helps find a passkey in the local storage corresponding to a given `rawId` and returns this passkey's public key.
- `getPasskeyFromRawId`, which helps reconstruct a full passkey from a `rawId` and a public key stored in local storage.

## 4. Add mint NFT functionality

Create a `mintNFT.ts` file in the `lib` folder to add functions to prepare and send a transaction minting an NFT from our yet-to-come Safe.

```tsx
touch mintNFT.ts
```

Add the following code to the `mintNFT.ts` file:

```tsx
// from ../../../examples/passkeys/lib/mintNFT.ts
```

With this configuration, a new Safe will be created (but not yet deployed) when a passkey is selected. This Safe will be deployed when its first transaction is executed.

**Note:** Minting an NFT was chosen here just as an example, and any other transaction would have the same effect.

## 5. Add UI components

Let's add a user interface to create and store a passkey on the user's device, deploy a safe, and sign the NFT transaction.

Create a `components` folder at the project root with a file named `PasskeyList.tsx`:

```bash
cd ..
mkdir components
cd components
touch PasskeyList.tsx
```

Add the following code to the `PasskeyList.tsx` file:

```tsx
// from ../../../examples/passkeys/components/PasskeyList.tsx
```

This component displays a list of previously created passkeys and a button for creating new ones.

Lastly, replace the content of the `page.tsx` file, within the `app` folder, with this code:

```tsx
// from ../../../examples/passkeys/app/page.tsx
```

This UI will put everything we built in the previous steps into a coherent application with all the functionality required to let you create a passkey, select it, and use it to sign a transaction.

## 6. (Optional) Add styling to the app

Because a web app is nothing without good styling, let's add some Safe design to our project 💅.

Still within the `app` folder, replace the existing content of the file `layout.tsx` with this code:

```tsx
// from ../../../examples/passkeys/app/layout.tsx
```

In the same folder, add some margin to the titles, by adding this code at the end of the `globals.css` file:

```css
h1,
h2,
h3 {
  margin-top: 40px;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}

button {
  cursor: pointer;
  border: none;
  background: #00E673;
  color: black;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border-radius: 5px;
  margin: 10px 0;
}
```

Finally, in the `public` folder, add these three icons. You can find them in the project's GitHub repository: [`safe.svg`](https://github.com/5afe/safe-passkeys-tutorial/blob/main/public/safe.svg), [`github.svg`](https://github.com/5afe/safe-passkeys-tutorial/blob/main/public/github.svg/), and [`external-link.svg`](https://github.com/5afe/safe-passkeys-tutorial/blob/main/public/external-link.svg).

## Testing your Safe passkeys app

That's it! You can find the source code for the example created in this tutorial [on GitHub](https://github.com/5afe/safe-passkeys-tutorial). You can now return to your browser and see the app displayed 🎉.

![safe-passkeys-app-1.png](../../../assets/safe-passkeys-app-1.png)

Click the **Add New Passkey** button to prompt a browser pop-up asking you to confirm the creation of a new passkey. This passkey will be stored in your browser's local storage and displayed in the list above the button.

Once confirmed, select this passkey by clicking **Select** next to it. This will prompt another pop-up window, this time asking to confirm the use of the previously created passkey.

![safe-passkeys-app-2.png](../../../assets/safe-passkeys-app-2.png)

At this stage, the app will have created a safe object awaiting deployment. By clicking **Sign transaction with passkey**, the deployment of this Safe will then be embedded in a batch transaction, along with the minting of the NFT.

## Do more with Safe and passkeys

We learned how to use passkeys (create them, store them, and use them securely) and how they can interact with a Safe (deploy it and send transactions). We hope you enjoyed this tutorial and that the combination of passkeys and the ERC-4337 will unlock new forms of ownership for your project and users.

You can now integrate passkeys with more transactions and functionalities of the Safe ecosystem. You can read more about passkeys in our [overview](../passkeys-overview) or in the [WebAuthn API documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Authentication_API).
