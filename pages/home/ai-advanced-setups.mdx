# Advanced Safe Smart Account Setups for AI Agents

Here you find advanced setups for Safe Smart Accounts for AI agents.

* Agent proposes transactions, human executes them
* Multi-agent setup
* Agent manages a certain amount of funds
* Agent is scoped to selected actions

## Agent proposes transactions, human executes them

In this setup, the AI agent proposes transactions, but one or more required human signers are needed to execute them.
This adds an additional layer of security, as the AI agent cannot execute transactions without human approval.

For this setup, we recommend a 2-out-of-3, 3-out-of-5, or 5-out-of-7 threshold.
The important considerations are:

* The AI agent should be one signer
* The threshold should be two more, so at least one human approval is required
* The amount of signers should be higher than the threshold to make sure the Safe Smart Account is functional when one key is lost

Here is an example setup:

```typescript
import { createSafeClient } from '@safe-global/sd

k-starter-kit'

const AGENT_ADDRESS = // ...
const AGENT_PRIVATE_KEY = // ...
const HUMAN_SIGNER_1_ADDRESS = // ...
const HUMAN_SIGNER_2_ADDRESS = // ...
const RPC_URL = 'https://rpc.ankr.com/eth_sepolia'

const safeClient = await createSafeClient({
  provider: RPC_URL,
  signer: AGENT_PRIVATE_KEY,
  safeOptions: {
    owners: [AGENT_ADDRESS, HUMAN_SIGNER_1_ADDRESS, HUMAN_SIGNER_2_ADDRESS],
    threshold: 2
  }
})
```

Here, the AI agent creates the Safe Smart Account and adds two human signers for a 2-out-of-3 setup.

## Multi-agent setup

In this setup, the Safe Smart Account is managed by multiple agents.
When one agent proposes a transaction, it needs to be approved by at least one other agent.
We recommend to have human signers as well, so that the Safe Smart Account is functional even without the AI agents.

Here is an example with a 2-out-of-4 setup:

```typescript
import { createSafeClient } from '@safe-global/sdk-starter-kit'

const AGENT_1_ADDRESS = // ...
const AGENT_1_PRIVATE_KEY = // ...
const AGENT_2_ADDRESS = // ...
const HUMAN_SIGNER_1_ADDRESS = // ...
const HUMAN_SIGNER_2_ADDRESS = // ...
const RPC_URL = 'https://rpc.ankr.com/eth_sepolia'

const safeClient = await createSafeClient({
  provider: RPC_URL,
  signer: AGENT_1_PRIVATE_KEY,
  safeOptions: {
    owners: [AGENT_1_ADDRESS, AGENT_2_ADDRESS, HUMAN_SIGNER_1_ADDRESS, HUMAN_SIGNER_2_ADDRESS],
    threshold: 2
  }
})
```

This setup is similar to the previous one.
The AI agents can make autonomous decisions, and the human signers can do so, too.

## Agent manages a certain amount of funds

This setup is used by DAO's or other organizations that want to utilize AI agents to manage their funds.




## Agent is scoped to selected actions
