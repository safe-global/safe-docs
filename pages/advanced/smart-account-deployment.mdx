# Deploying Smart Accounts

To save deployment gas costs, users will deploy a `SafeProxy` contract instead of deploying the complete bytecode of Smart Account and associated contracts. The `SafeProxy` delegates all calls to a singleton contract, whose address is stored at `slot(0)` of the proxy contract. This means that the proxy contract itself is lightweight and inexpensive to deploy, while the actual logic is handled by the singleton contract.

The `SafeProxyFactory` contract is used to deploy `SafeProxy` contracts. The `SafeProxyFactory` contract provides various functions to deploy a `SafeProxy` contract which are given below.
The address of the proxy depends on the address of the `SafeProxyFactory` contract, `intializer` data, and the salt used to deploy the proxy.

## Functions available to deploy a `SafeProxy` contract
