# Get the Safe CLI

The Safe CLI can be run using [Docker](https://www.docker.com) or [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable).

## Using Docker

**Prerequisite:** Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

Once Docker is installed on your system, run the following command to create new Safe accounts:

```bash
docker run -it safeglobal/safe-cli safe-creator
```

You can also run the following command to run the Safe CLI with an existing Safe:
```bash
docker run -it safeglobal/safe-cli safe-cli <checksummed_safe_address> <ethereum_node_url>
```

## Using Python pip

**Prerequisite:** [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) >= 3.9 (Python 3.12 is recommended).

Once Python is installed on your system, run the following command to install the Safe CLI:
```bash
pip3 install -U safe-cli
```
