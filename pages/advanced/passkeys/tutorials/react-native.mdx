# How to build a React Native app with Safe and passkeys

An increasing number of applications rely on passkeys to authenticate users securely and with little friction. Security and user-friendliness are crucial to making web3 a reality for the next billion users.
Being able to unlock a Safe Smart Account with your fingerprints or Face ID, sending transactions without worrying about third-party wallet interfaces, phishing attempts, or securing seed phrases will bring new forms of ownership to the connected world.
Today, we'll learn how to use passkeys with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev) and [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev).

This tutorial will show you how to create a React Native app for using [passkeys](../overview.mdx) in your Safe. This app will enable you to:

- Deploy a new Safe on Ethereum Sepolia.
- Create a new passkey secured by the user's device.
- Sign messages and create transactions using the passkey as a signer.

This is how the final app will look:

- Have a [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) account to create an HTTPS tunnel to your server.

**Note:** If you wish to follow along using the completed project, you can [check out the GitHub repository](https://github.com/5afe/react-native-passkeys-tutorial) for this tutorial.

## 1. Setup a React Native app using Expo

### Initialize a new project

Initialize a new React Native project using Expo by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx create-expo-app@latest --template blank-typescript
```

When prompted by the CLI, enter the name of the application (for example, react-native-passkeys).

### Install dependencies

Run the following command to add the project dependencies:

```bash
cd react-native-passkeys
npm install @safe-global/protocol-kit react-native-passkeys react-native-base64 @react-native-async-storage/async-storage react-native-prompt-android expo-build-properties
```

### Configure your development environment to use React Native and Expo

You need to configure your environment. If you are a React Native developer, you may have already set everything up. However, if you are new to React Native, you should prepare your environment. The best option is to follow the [official Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment).

We will use emulators and development builds in this tutorial, so please refer to the relevant sections in the Expo documentation for proper configuration. If you know how to do that or want to use a physical device, you can skip these steps. If you only want to test one platform, that's fine too, you only need to follow one of the steps below:

- [**Android Studio Emulator**](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/?platform=android&device=simulated&mode=development-build)
- [**iOS Simulator**](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/?platform=ios&device=simulated&mode=development-build)

When [creating the emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/?platform=android&device=simulated&mode=development-build#set-up-an-emulator) using Android Studio Device Manager, ensure that you include one with Play Store services, as this is required for passkeys. The version 17 of the Java Development Kit (JDK) is used to compile the project, make sure that you are [using the correct version](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30631286/how-to-specify-the-jdk-version-in-android-studio) before running the emulator.

![react-native-passkeys-app-2.png](../../../../assets/react-native-passkeys-play-store.png)

### Add environment variables

Create a file named `.env` in the root of your project and add the following keys:

```bash
// from ../../../../examples/react-native-passkeys/.env-sample
```

Replace `add_private_key_here` by a private key you own, and `0xOwnerAddress1` by one or more public addresses you own. These addresses will be used to deploy the Safe and add passkey owners.

### Run emulators

After completing all these configurations ðŸ™ƒ, you can finally run the local development build of the app on the emulators (Emulators should be running) by using the following commands:

```bash
npx expo run:android
npx expo run:ios
```

You can now begin developing the app.

![react-native-passkeys-app-2.png](../../../../assets/react-native-passkeys-app-2.png)

## 2. Add project lib folder

Create a `lib` folder at the project root. This is the folder where we will include the logic to store and retrieve the passkey:

```bash
mkdir lib
cd lib
```

## 3. Add storage functionality

Create a `storage.ts` file inside the `lib` folder:

```bash
touch storage.ts
```

Add the following code to the `storage.ts` file:

```tsx
// from ../../../../examples/react-native-passkeys/lib/storage.ts
```

This file will contain all the logic to store the passkey in the device storage or in the web local storage depending on the platform.

## 4. Add passkeys functionality

Create a `passkeys.ts` file inside the lib folder:

```bash
touch passkeys.ts
```

Add the following code to the `passkeys.ts` file:

```tsx
// from ../../../../examples/react-native-passkeys/lib/passkeys.ts
```

We are adding 2 main functions here:

- `createPasskey` helps generate a new passkey using `react-native-passkeys`.
- `getPasskey` retrieves the passkey using the `react-native-passkeys` library. This method is necessary for pass to the [protocol-kit init](https://docs.safe.global/reference-sdk-protocol-kit/initialization/init) method and will be used to sign any message or transaction.

## 5. Add Safe functionality

Create a `safe.ts` file inside the lib folder:

```bash
touch safe.ts
```

Add the following code to the `safe.ts` file:

```tsx
// from ../../../../examples/react-native-passkeys/lib/safe.ts
```

We are introducing four new methods to securely deploy, sign messages, and execute transactions.

- `activateAccount` will deploy a new Safe account on Sepolia based on the predicted configuration.
- `addPasskeyOwner` adds a new passkey owner to the Safe account.
- `signPasskeyMessage` helps sign messages using the passkey signer.
- `sendDummyPasskeyTransaction` creates and executes a dummy on-chain rejection transaction to test the passkey signer.

## 6. Add UI functionality

Using the existing `App.tsx` file, we will add UI components to interact with the Safe account and passkeys. Let's update the entire content and use this instead:

```tsx
// from ../../../../examples/react-native-passkeys/App.tsx
```

Now we should have a functional app that enables users to activate their Safe account and interact with passkeys.

![react-native-passkeys-app-3.png](../../../../assets/react-native-passkeys-app-3.png)

## 7. Setup emulator specific registration files

To use passkeys in the app, you need to complete some additional setup in the Android and iOS projects. To facilitate this, we are providing a simple [Node Express web server](https://github.com/5afe/aasa-server) for testing.

Clone and install the repository with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/5afe/aasa-server.git
```

{/* <!-- vale off --> */}

<Tabs items={['iOS', 'Android']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    - Login or subscribe to the Apple Developer Program and [locate your Team
    ID](https://developer.apple.com/help/account/manage-your-team/locate-your-team-id/).
    - In the `apple-app-site-association` file in the AASA server, add your Team ID instead of `add_your_apple_team_id_here`, and a bundle identifier (following this convention `com.<your_team_name>.<your_app_name>`) instead of `add_your_package_name_here`.
    - Activate FaceId. Go to Features > Face ID > Enrolled in the iOS simulator menu.
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    - Add a Google account in the settings of the Android emulated phone.
    - Get an Android keystore SHA 256 fingerprint with this command (from the root
    of your project):
```bash
keytool -list -v -keystore ./android/app/debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android
```
    - Copy the value in front of `SHA 256` at the place of `add_your_sha256_cert_fingerprints_here` in the assetslinks.json file.
    - Add a bundle identifier (following this convention `com.<your_team_name>.<your_app_name>`) instead of `add_your_package_name`
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

{/* <!-- vale on --> */}

Fill in your data in the `apple-app-site-association` (if you are using iOS) or `assetlinks.json` (if using android) files as explained above. You can now start the server with:

```bash
cd aasa-server
npm install
npm start
```

Once you have it running, you need a public domain secured with SSL to test the passkeys (`localhost` is not valid). You can use a service like [ngrok](https://download.ngrok.com/mac-os) to create a tunnel to your local server.

After the installation, create a tunnel to the localhost port you are using, which should be `3000` if you are using the provided server.

```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

The ngrok service will provide you with a public domain. You must copy this domain (without `https://`) and add it to [passkeys.ts](https://github.com/5afe/react-native-passkeys-tutorial/blob/913cc17f353062bf1c4c55ad303e8623b6035a6b/lib/passkeys.ts#L8) (line 8).

Replace your project's `app.json` with the following:

```json
// from ../../../../examples/react-native-passkeys/app.json
```

In the `associatedDomains` array, replace `add_your_ngrok_domain_here` with your public ngrok domain; replace `your_apple_team_id_here` with your Apple Developer Program Team ID; lastly replace the two occurrences of `com.<your_organization>.<your_app_name>` with your app's package name (it must be the same than the one in the `apple-app-site-association` or `assetlinks.json` file).

Delete the `/ios` and `/android` folders and restart the app (`npx expo run:ios` or `npx expo run:android`) to apply the changes.

## Do more with passkeys

We learned how to use passkeys (create them, store them, and use them securely) and how they can interact with a Safe (deploy it and send transactions). We hope you enjoyed this tutorial and that the combination of passkeys and the ERC-4337 will unlock new forms of ownership for your project and users.

You can now integrate passkeys with more transactions and functionalities of the Safe ecosystem. You can read more about passkeys in our [overview](/advanced/passkeys/overview) or in the [WebAuthn API documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Authentication_API).
