# Operations for the `tx-service` mode

## Return balance

Returns a list of balances for ERC-20 tokens and ether.

```bash
balances
```

## Transactions

### Return transaction history

Returns history of multi-signature transactions (including pending).

```bash
history
```

### Execute a pending transaction

Execute a pending transaction with enough signatures.

```bash
execute-tx <safe-tx-hash>
```

### Sign transaction

Sign a transaction with the loaded owners for the provided Safe transaction hash.

```bash
sign-tx <safe-tx-hash>
```

### Sign message

Sign the provided string message provided by standard input or the `EIP712` provided by file.

```bash
sign_message [--eip191_message <str>] [--eip712_path <file-path>]
```

### Batch transactions

Batch transactions into one Multisig transaction using the provided `safe-nonce.` Any safe-tx can be used, like transactions from other Safes, already executed transactions, pending execution, etc. The only limitation is that the *transactions from other networks cannot be used*. The batching order will follow the same order of the `safe-tx-hashes` provided.

```bash
batch-txs <safe-nonce> <safe-tx-hash> [ <safe-tx-hash> ... ]
```

### Remove proposed transaction

Removes a proposed non-executed transaction with the owner's signature that proposed the transaction.

```bash
remove_proposed_transaction <safe_tx_hsh>
```

## Delegates

### Return delegates

Returns a list of *delegates* for the Safe. A *delegate* can be used when you *trust an address to post transactions to the tx-service on your behalf*. If a transaction is not trusted (posted to the service and not signed by a delegate or an owner of the Safe), it will be stored in the service but not shown in the Safe \{Wallet\} web interface
and mobile app.

```bash
get_delegates
```

### Add delegate

Adds a new delegate `address` for the `owner` of the Safe.

```bash
add_delegate <address> <label> <owner-address>
```

### Remove delegate

Removes a delegate `address` from the Safe.

```bash
remove_delegate <address> <owner-address>
```
