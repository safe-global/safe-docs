# Commands specific to the `tx-service` mode

Here's a reference for commands specific to the `tx-service` mode.

## Return balance

Returns a list of balances for ERC-20 tokens and ether.

```bash
balances
```

## Transactions

### Return transaction history

Returns history of multi-signature transactions (including pending).

```bash
history
```

### Execute pending transaction

Execute a pending transaction with enough signatures.

```bash
execute-tx <safe-tx-hash>
```

### Sign transaction

Sign a transaction with the loaded owners for the provided Safe transaction hash.

```bash
sign-tx <safe-tx-hash>
```

### Sign message

Sign the string message provided by the standard input or the EIP-712 provided by the file.

```bash
sign_message [--eip191_message <str>] [--eip712_path <file-path>]
```

### Batch transactions

Batch transactions into one multi-signature transaction using the provided `safe-nonce.` Any `safe-tx` can be used, like transactions from other Safe accounts, already executed transactions, pending execution, etc. The only limitation is that the transactions from other networks cannot be used. The batching order will follow the same order of the `safe-tx-hashes` provided.

```bash
batch-txs <safe-nonce> <safe-tx-hash> [ <safe-tx-hash> ... ]
```

### Remove proposed transaction

Removes a proposed non-executed transaction with the owner's signature that proposed the transaction.

```bash
remove_proposed_transaction <safe_tx_hsh>
```

## Delegates

### Return delegates

Returns a list of delegates for the Safe. A delegate can be used when you trust an address to post transactions to the tx-service on your behalf. If a transaction is not trusted (posted to the service and not signed by a delegate or an owner of the Safe), it will be stored in the service but not shown in Safe \{Wallet\}.

```bash
get_delegates
```

### Add delegate

Adds a new delegate `address` for the `owner` of the Safe.

```bash
add_delegate <address> <label> <owner-address>
```

### Remove delegate

Removes a delegate `address` from the Safe.

```bash
remove_delegate <address> <owner-address>
```
