# Reference

Safe CLI has two operation modes:

- **blockchain**: The default mode. Use the `blockchain` command to enable it. Transactions are sent to the blockchain.
- **tx-service**: Use the `tx-service` command to enable it. Transactions are sent to the Safe Transaction Service (if available on the network), and you can see them on the Safe \{Wallet\} web interface
and mobile app. At least one signer is needed to send transactions to the service. Transactions are *not executed*. It requires *Safe\{Core\} API running on the network*.

## Use custom contracts

Safe CLI comes with the official deterministic Safe contract addresses deployed on multiple chains configured by default. If you want to use your own, you can edit the file `safe_cli/safe_addresses.py`

Be careful when modifying these addresses, as the funds in a Safe can get stuck if an invalid address is used when updating to an invalid Safe Master Copy.
