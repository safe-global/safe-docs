# Add New Networks

Safe's vision is to make every web3 account a smart account. Therefore, we prioritize teams and chains building with smart accounts, especially if they push account abstraction (for example, ERC-4337/EIP-1271 adoption) with Safe (learn more [here](https://docs.safe.global/home/4337-safe)).

Safe's security is based on the contracts deployed in EVM-compatible networks. For the time being, we are not looking to extend beyond EVM.

To have the full Safe stack running on your chain network, you need to consider the following steps:

<Steps>

  ### Deploy Safe canonical contracts

  #### Process

    1. Follow the steps in the [safe-contracts](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-contracts#deploy) GitHub repository.
    2. Create a GitHub issue using the [Add new chain](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-deployments/issues/new?assignees=&labels=%5Benhancement%5D&projects=&template=new_chain.yaml&title=%5BNew+chain%5D%3A+) template in the [safe-deployments](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-deployments) repository.
    3. Create a Pull Request with the new Safe contract addresses in the [safe-deployments](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-deployments) repository.

  #### Cost

  The contracts are fully open source, but gas is needed in the native currency of the new chain for contract deployment.

  #### Timeline

  Pull Requests on Safe's GitHub are reviewed roughly on a two-week cadence.

  ### Deploy and maintain Safe\{Wallet\} and Safe\{Core\} infrastructure

  #### Process

  1. Two possible options are available:
      - Native integration in [Safe\{Wallet\}](https://app.safe.global): The Safe team runs all the infrastructure.
        - Fill out [this form](https://noteforms.com/forms/request-safe-ui-and-infra-support-4weugt) with your request.
        - The Safe team evaluates the chains that need Safe\{Wallet\} or Safe\{Core\} support every quarter based on a priority matrix.
      - Forked integration: All the infrastructure is run by a dedicated team who can be the new supported chain itself or an ecosystem third party like [Protofire](https://protofire.io) or [Den](https://www.onchainden.com).
  2. Enter into agreement with your chosen provider.

  #### Cost

  - Safe is fully open source but requires someone to run and maintain the [web interface](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-wallet-web) and [infrastructure](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-infrastructure/blob/main/docs/running_production.md).
  - Cost is based on the individual agreement (if run by any third party, including Safe).
  - Primary cost factors:
    - Deployment costs.
    - Indexing.
    - Cloud storage and monitoring services.

  #### Timeline

  - Based on the individual agreement with Safe.
  - Prioritisation for native integration ([app.safe.global](https://app.safe.global)) is primarily based on the network's smart account/account abstraction strategy (for example, is every user account a Safe under the hood beyond the usage of Safe as a multi-signature for treasury management?) and [additional metrics](https://noteforms.com/forms/request-safe-ui-and-infra-support-4weugt).
