# Load owners

## From private key

Loading owners is unnecessary if you want to do `read-only` operations.

To load owners:

```
> load_cli_owners <account_private_key>
Loaded account 0xab...cd with balance=123 ether
Set account 0xab..cd as default sender of txs
```

You can also load owners from your environment variables before running the Safe CLI:

```bash
export MY_PRIVATE_KEY=YOUR_EOA_PRIVATE_KEY
```

Run the Safe-CLI, then:

```
> load_cli_owners MY_PRIVATE_KEY
Loaded account 0xab...cd with balance=123 ether
Set account 0xab..cd as default sender of txs
```

To check the loaded owners:

```
> show_cli_owners
```

To unload an owner:

```
> unload_cli_owners <ethereum_checksummed_address>
```

## From hardware wallets

<Callout type='info' emoji='ℹ️'>
  Before signing anything, ensure that the data on your hardware wallet device is the same as the Safe CLI data.
</Callout>

If you want to use both Ledger and Trezor, you need to run the following command:

```bash
pip install "safe-cli[ledger, trezor]"
```

### Ledger

The Ledger module is an optional feature of Safe CLI to sign transactions with the help of [ledgereth](https://github.com/mikeshultz/ledger-eth-lib) library based on [ledgerblue](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/blue-loader-python).

To enable, the Safe CLI must be installed as follows:

```bash
pip install "safe-cli[ledger]"
```

When running on Linux, make sure the following rules have been added to `/etc/udev/rules.d/`:

```commandline
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="2c97", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0000", MODE="0660", TAG+="uaccess", TAG+="udev-acl" OWNER="<UNIX username>"
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="2c97", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0001", MODE="0660", TAG+="uaccess", TAG+="udev-acl" OWNER="<UNIX username>"
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="2c97", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0004", MODE="0660", TAG+="uaccess", TAG+="udev-acl" OWNER="<UNIX username>"
```

#### Ledger commands

- `load_ledger_cli_owners [--legacy-accounts] [--derivation-path <str>]`: show a list of the first five accounts (--legacy-accounts search using legacy derivation) or load an account from provided derivation path.

### Trezor

The Trezor module is an optional feature of Safe CLI to sign transactions from the Trezor hardware wallet using the [trezor](https://pypi.org/project/trezor/) library.

To enable, Safe CLI must be installed as follows:

```bash
pip install "safe-cli[trezor]"
```

#### Trezor commands

- `load_trezor_cli_owners [--legacy-accounts] [--derivation-path <str>]`: show a list of the first five accounts (--legacy-accounts search using legacy derivation) or load an account from provided derivation path.
