# Load a Safe

To load a Safe, use the following command:

```bash
safe-cli <checksummed_safe_address> <ethereum_node_url>
```

Then you should be on the prompt and see information about the Safe, like the owners, version, etc.

The next step would be loading some owners for the Safe. At least `threshold` owners need to be loaded to do operations
on the Safe, and at least one should have funds to send transactions.
