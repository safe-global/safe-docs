# Safe Smart Account

The vision for Safe Smart Accounts is to become the standard core used in all smart contract-based wallets. It also aims to make the benefits of Account Abstraction accessible to users and developers.

The architectural design of Safe Smart Account keeps the following principles in mind.

## Components

Here are some core components of a Safe Smart Account that you will learn about:

### Safe Modules

[Safe Modules](smart-account-modules.mdx) are smart contracts that extend Safe's functionality with added custom features while the module logic remains separate from Safe's core contracts. 

### Safe Guards

[Safe Guards](smart-account-guards.mdx) make checks before and after a Safe transaction.

### Signatures

Safe contracts support alternative signature schemes such as [EIP-1271](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271) and [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) and relaying by making the confirmation/verification logic independent of `msg.sender`.
