# Safe Smart Account

The vision for Safe Smart Accounts is to become the standard core used in all smart contract-based wallets. It also aims to make the benefits of Account Abstraction accessible to users and developers.

The architectural design of Safe Smart Account keeps the following principles in mind.

<Grid
  container
  spacing={2}
  display='flex'
  alignContent='flex-start'
  mt={3}
>
  <Grid item xs={12} md={6}>
    <CustomCard
      title={'Secure default'}
      description={'Uses a multi-signature logic where a threshold of owners must confirm a transaction before execution to provide a secure default without trusting any additional contract. For example, a module, guard, or fallback handler (explained below).'}
      url={''}
      icon={<SafeCoreSDK />}
      newTab={false}
    />
  </Grid>
  <Grid item xs={12} md={6}>
    <CustomCard
      title={'Maximum flexibility'}
      description={'Supports modules that execute transactions using alternative access patterns (instead of multi-signature). Also supports the delegatecall function, which introduces complex execution logic by loading instructions from other contracts and executing via a Safe Smart Account.'}

  </Grid>
</Grid>

## Components

Here are some core components of a Safe Smart Account that you will learn about:

### Safe Modules

[Safe Modules](smart-account-modules.mdx) are smart contracts that extend Safe's functionality with added custom features while the module logic remains separate from Safe's core contracts. 

### Safe Guards

[Safe Guards](smart-account-guards.mdx) make checks before and after a Safe transaction.

### Signatures

Safe contracts support alternative signature schemes such as [EIP-1271](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271) and [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) and relaying by making the confirmation/verification logic independent of `msg.sender`. Read more about the [signature schemes](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-smart-account/blob/main/docs/signatures.md) supported by Safe.
