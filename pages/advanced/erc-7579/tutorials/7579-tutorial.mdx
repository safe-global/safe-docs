# How to build an app with Safe and ERC-7579

The smart account ecosystem needed to be more cohesive, with each provider building its modules, often incompatible with other smart account implementations. Developers had to build new modules compatible with their smart accounts or miss out on essential application features.

[ERC-7579](https://docs.safe.global/advanced/erc-7579/overview) aims to ensure interoperability across implementations. It defines the account interface so developers can implement modules for all smart accounts that follow this standard. The Safe7579 Adapter makes your Safe compatible with any ERC-7579 modules. As a developer building with Safe, you can access a rich ecosystem of modules to add features to your application.

In this tutorial, you will build an app that can:

- Enable a 7579 module on a newly deployed Safe (the [OwnableExecutor](https://github.com/rhinestonewtf/core-modules/blob/main/src/OwnableExecutor/OwnableExecutor.sol) module by Rhinestone)
- Send a transaction via the 7579 module (Send a dummy transaction as the new owner via `executeOnOwnedAccount`)
- Interact with the 7579 directly to add a new owner to the module

You can find the full code for this tutorial in the [Safe7579 module tutorial repository](https://github.com/5afe/safe-7579-tutorial).

## Prerequisites

**Prerequisite knowledge:** You will need some basic experience with [React](https://react.dev/learn), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs), [ERC-4337](https://docs.safe.global/home/4337-overview) and [ERC-7579](https://docs.safe.global/advanced/erc-7579/overview).

Before progressing with the tutorial, please make sure you have the following:

- Downloaded and installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation).
- Created an API key from [Pimlico](https://www.pimlico.io/).
- Two private keys for testing purposes. The second key will need some funds to pay for gas.

## 1. Setup a Next.js application

Initialize a new Next.js app using pnpm with the following command:

```shell
pnpm create next-app
```

When prompted by the CLI:

- Select `yes` to TypeScript, ESLint, and App router.
- Select `no` to all other questions (Tailwind, `src` directory, and import aliases).

### Install dependencies

For this project, you will use Pimlico's [Permissionless.js](https://docs.pimlico.io/permissionless) to set up a Safe and interact with it and [viem](https://www.npmjs.com/package/viem) for some helper functions.

<Callout type='warning' emoji='⚠️'>
 Currently, `permissionless.js` can only be used to deploy single-signer Safe accounts. Multi-signature ERC-7579 Safes will be coming soon.
</Callout>

Run the following command to add all these dependencies to the project:

```shell
pnpm add permissionless@0.2.0 viem@2
```

## 2. Setup project

First, set up the project and add some UI and styles so you can focus on the 7579-related code for the rest of the tutorial.

### Add CSS

Replace the content of `app/globals.css` with the following:

```css
:root {
  background-color: #121312; 
  font-family: 'DM Sans', sans-serif;
  font-size: 13px;
}

* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  color: #fff;
}

button {
  background-color: #12ff80;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 6px;
  color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87);
  cursor: pointer;
  font-weight: bold;
  padding: 8px 24px;
  margin-top: 24px;
  margin-bottom: 24px;
  display: block;
}

body {
  align-items: center;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: space-between;
  margin: 6rem auto;
  width: 500px;
}

.card {
  background-color: #1c1c1c;
  border-radius: 6px;
  margin-bottom: 24px;
  padding: 24px;
  text-align: left;
  width: 100%;
  align-items: center;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.title {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 10px;
  font-size: large;
}

pre {
  border: 1px solid #303033;
  border-radius: 8px;
  color: #a1a3a7;
  margin: 24px 0;
  padding: 24px;
  text-align: center;
}
```

### Add a scaffold React component

Now, replace the content of `app/page.tsx` with the following code. It includes all necessary imports, the React component and the UI, and empty functions that you will fill with code in the following steps. From now on, you will only work on this file.

```tsx
'use client'

import { createSmartAccountClient } from 'permissionless'
import { sepolia } from 'viem/chains'
import { encodePacked, http, encodeFunctionData, parseAbi } from 'viem'
import { erc7579Actions } from 'permissionless/actions/erc7579'
import { createPublicClient, createWalletClient } from 'viem'
import { privateKeyToAccount } from 'viem/accounts'
import { createPimlicoClient } from 'permissionless/clients/pimlico'
import { toSafeSmartAccount } from 'permissionless/accounts'
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'

export default function Home () {
  const [safeAccount, setSafeAccount] = useState(null)
  const [pimlicoClient, setPimlicoClient] = useState(null)
  const [smartAccountClient, setSmartAccountClient] = useState(null)

  // The module is deployed as a smart contract on Sepolia:
  const ownableExecutorModule = '0xc98B026383885F41d9a995f85FC480E9bb8bB891'

  //  Make sure to add your own API key to the Pimlico URL:
  const pimlicoUrl =
    'https://api.pimlico.io/v2/sepolia/rpc?apikey=YOUR_PIMLICO_API_KEY'
    

  // You will use two accounts for this example:
  // owner is the account that owns the smart account and will install the module.
  // owner2 is the account that will be added as an owner to the smart account via the module.
  // Both accounts are created from private keys. Make sure to replace them with your own private keys.
  // These are the private keys of anvil, don't use them in production, don't send any real funds to these accounts.
  const owner = privateKeyToAccount(
    '0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80'
  )

  const owner2 = privateKeyToAccount(
    '0x59c6995e998f97a5a0044966f0945389dc9e86dae88c7a8412f4603b6b78690d'
  )

  // These functions will be filled with code in the following steps:

  useEffect(() => {
    const init = async () => {}
    init()
  }, [])

  const installModule = async () => {}

  const executeOnOwnedAccount = async () => {}

  const addOwner = async () => {}

  return (
    <div className='card'>
      <div className='title'>Safe 7579 Module</div>
      <button onClick={installModule}>Install Module</button>
      <button onClick={executeOnOwnedAccount}>Execute on owned account</button>
      <button onClick={addOwner}>Add Owner</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Make sure to add your Pimlico API key to the `pimlicoUrl` variable. You can find your API key in the Pimlico dashboard.

Also, replace the private keys in the `owner` and `owner2` variables with your own private keys for testing purposes. 

You can now run the development server with `pnpm dev` and open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`. You should see a simple UI with three buttons. 

## 3. Initialize the clients

In the first step, you create the clients that allow you to interact with the smart account. As permissionless.js is just a tiny wrapper around viem, you will use many of viem's functions in this tutorial. 

To add this code, overwrite the `useEffect` function with this one:

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  const init = async () => {
    // The public client by viem is used as a transport layer:
    const publicClient = createPublicClient({
      transport: http('https://rpc.ankr.com/eth_sepolia'),
      chain: sepolia
    })

    // The safe account is created using the public client:
    const safeAccount = await toSafeSmartAccount({
      client: publicClient,
      owners: [owner],
      version: '1.4.1',
      chain: sepolia,
      // These modules are required for the 7579 functionality:
      safe4337ModuleAddress: '0x3Fdb5BC686e861480ef99A6E3FaAe03c0b9F32e2', // These are not meant to be used in production as of now.
      erc7579LaunchpadAddress: '0xEBe001b3D534B9B6E2500FB78E67a1A137f561CE' // These are not meant to be used in production as of now.
    })

    // The Pimlico client is used as a paymaster:
    const pimlicoClient = createPimlicoClient({
      transport: http(pimlicoUrl),
      chain: sepolia
    })

    // Finally, create the smart account client, which provides functionality to interact with the smart account:
    const smartAccountClient = createSmartAccountClient({
      account: safeAccount,
      chain: sepolia,
      bundlerTransport: http(pimlicoUrl),
      paymaster: pimlicoClient,
      userOperation: {
        estimateFeesPerGas: async () => {
          return (await pimlicoClient.getUserOperationGasPrice()).fast
        }
      }
    }).extend(erc7579Actions())

    // Store the clients in the state to use them in the following steps:
    setSafeAccount(safeAccount)
    setPimlicoClient(pimlicoClient)
    setSmartAccountClient(smartAccountClient)

    console.log('setup done')
  }

  init()
}, [])
```

If you run your app with `pnpm dev`, the console will log ‘setup done’ when everything works.

## 4. Install the 7579 module

Now, add the call that will add the `OwnableExecutor` module to your smart account.

Overwrite the `installModule` function with this one.

```tsx
const installModule = async () => {
  console.log('Installing module...')

  // The smart accounts client operates on 4337. It does not send transactions directly but instead creates user
  // operations. The Pimlico bundler takes those user operations and sends them to the blockchain as regular
  // transactions. We also use the Pimlico paymaster to sponsor the transaction. So, all interactions are free
  // on Sepolia.
  const userOpHash = await smartAccountClient.installModule({
    type: 'executor',
    address: ownableExecutorModule,
    context: encodePacked(['address'], [owner2.address])
  })

  console.log('User operation hash:', userOpHash, '\nwaiting for receipt...')

  // After sending the user operation, wait for the transaction to be settled:
  const transactionReceipt = await pimlicoClient.waitForUserOperationReceipt({
    hash: userOpHash
  })

  console.log('Module installed:', transactionReceipt)
}
```

When you open the UI now and click the “Install Module” button, the console should log the module installation process. You can use [jiffyscan.xyz](https://jiffyscan.xyz/) to inspect the user operation hash. From there, you can copy the transaction hash and inspect the transaction with [Etherscan](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/), [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/), or other block explorers.

## 5. Send a transaction via the 7579 module

In the following function, you will use the `OwnableExecutor` module. The module allows owners to execute transactions from the smart account without collecting signatures. For this example, you will send a dummy transaction that sends zero eth to owner1. 

In detail:

1. Owner2 calls module
2. The module calls `executeAsModule` on the smart account
3. The smart account executes the transaction (and sends zero eth to owner1)

Replace the `executeOnOwnedAccount` function with this code:

```tsx
const executeOnOwnedAccount = async () => {
  console.log('Executing on owned account...')

  // Create a wallet client for the owner2 account. This client is used to send transactions on behalf of the
  // owner2. This transaction is sent as a regular transaction, so it is not free. Make sure owner2 owns enough funds
  // to pay for gas.
  const walletClient = createWalletClient({
    account: owner2,
    transport: http('https://rpc.ankr.com/eth_sepolia'),
    chain: sepolia
  })

  console.log('wallet client', walletClient)

  // Encode the transaction you want the smart account to send. The fields are:
  // - to (address)
  // - value (uint256)
  // - data (bytes)
  // In this example case, it is a dummy transaction with zero data.
  const executeOnOwnedAccountData = encodePacked(
    ['address', 'uint256', 'bytes'],
    ['0xa6d3DEBAAB2B8093e69109f23A75501F864F74e2', 0n, '0x']
  )

  // Now, call the `executeOnOwnedAccount` function of the `ownableExecutorModule` with the address of the safe
  // account and the data you want to execute. This will make the smart account send the transaction that is encoded above.
  const hash = await walletClient.writeContract({
    abi: parseAbi(['function executeOnOwnedAccount(address, bytes)']),
    functionName: 'executeOnOwnedAccount',
    args: [safeAccount?.address, executeOnOwnedAccountData],
    address: ownableExecutorModule
  })

  console.log('Executed on owned account, transaction hash:', hash)
}
```

Now, when you open the UI and click the “Execute on owned account” button, your console should log the transaction. You can inspect the transaction with Tenderly to follow the call stack from the module over the Safe 7579 adapter, to your Safe, and to the final receiver of the transaction.

You also learned which data format is used to send a 7579 transaction from a module to a Safe. It is exactly the data you packed for the transaction in `executeOnOwnedAccountData`. Every other 7579 module uses the same data type to send transactions to a Safe. But with most other modules, you don’t have to pack the data yourself; you just call a function on the module, and the module sends the dedicated transaction to the smart account.

## 6. Interact with the 7579 module directly

Some modules can be configured directly. The `OwnableExecutor` module allows you to add additional owners and remove existing owners. This example outlines how you interact with the module directly to add a new owner.

The call flow is:

1. Sign a user operation with your smart account client and send it to the bundler.
2. The bundler bundles the user operation into a regular transaction and sends it to the meme pool.
3. The transaction executes a call from your smart account call the module with the defined data.
4. The module recognizes your smart account as an authorized sender. It stores the new owner of your smart account in its storage.

Replace `addOwner` with this function:

```tsx
const addOwner = async () => {
  console.log('Adding owner...')

  // The addOwner function is part of the OwnableExecutorModule. Encode the function data using the viem library:
  const addOwnerData = encodeFunctionData({
    abi: parseAbi(['function addOwner(address)']),
    functionName: 'addOwner',
    args: ['0x3C44CdDdB6a900fa2b585dd299e03d12FA4293BC']
  })

  // Use the smart account client to send the user operation: In this call, the smart account calls the `addOwner`
  // function at the `ownableExecutorModule` with the new owner's address.
  const userOp = await smartAccountClient.sendUserOperation({
    calls: [{ to: ownableExecutorModule, value: 0, data: addOwnerData }]
  })

  console.log('User operation:', userOp, '\nwaiting for tx receipt...')

  // Wait for the transaction to be settled:
  const receipt = await pimlicoClient.waitForUserOperationReceipt({
    hash: userOp
  })

  console.log('Owner added, tx receipt:', receipt)
}
```

When you open the UI and click the “Add Owner” button, your console should log the user operation that adds a new owner. Make sure to inspect the final transaction (you can get the transaction hash from jiffyscan.xyz) to understand the call stack from the smart account to the module.

That’s it! You have successfully built an app that can interact with a Safe Smart Account using the ERC-7579 standard. You can now deploy and test your app with your Safes and modules.


## Do more with Safe and ERC-7579

You learned how to deploy an ERC-7579-compatible Safe Smart Account and use an ERC-7579-compatible module, the OwnableExecutor from Rhinestone. We hope you enjoyed this tutorial and that the combination of Safe and 7579 will allow you to tap into new functionalities for your decentralized apps.

As a next step, you can add more functionalities to your app using other [ERC-7579-compatible modules](https://docs.rhinestone.wtf/module-sdk/modules/ownable-validator).

You can also find more inspiration on this list of [ERC-7579 modules](https://erc7579.com/modules). You can also read more about this ERC in our [overview](https://docs.safe.global/advanced/erc-7579/overview) or the [official documentation](https://erc7579.com/).
