# Safe and EIP-7702

EIP-7702 does not specify how to initialise the storage of the account but only gives a way to set the code of the account.
This means that the account will be created with an empty storage, and the user will have to set the storage manually.

Existing Safe contracts cannot be used with EIP-7702, because delegating to Safe Singleton or the Proxy contract will expose the EOA account to the risk of front-runing during setup.

## Possible approaches

- Modified Safe Singleton

[SafeEIP7702](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-smart-account/blob/feature/eip-7702/contracts/experimental/SafeEIP7702.sol)

- Modified Safe Proxy and Safe Singleton

[SafeEIP7702Proxy](https://github.com/5afe/safe-eip7702/blob/main/safe-eip7702-contracts/contracts/SafeEIP7702Proxy.sol)

- SafeLite

[SafeLite](https://github.com/5afe/safe-eip7702/blob/main/safe-eip7702-contracts/contracts/experimental/SafeLite.sol)

### Comparison table

| Feature | SafeEIP7702 | SafeEIP7702Proxy | SafeLite |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Existing Wallet UI Compatibility | Partially | Full | Not usable |
| Gas overhead | Between SafeLite and SafeEIP7702Proxy approach | High as new Proxy has to be deployed for each EOA | Least |
