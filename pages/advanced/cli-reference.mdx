# Reference

The Safe CLI has two operation modes:

- **blockchain**: The default mode. Use the `blockchain` command to enable it. Transactions are sent to the blockchain.
- **tx-service**: Use the `tx-service` command to enable it. Transactions are sent to the Safe Transaction Service (if available on the network), and you can see them on Safe\{Wallet\}. At least one signer is needed to send transactions to the service. Transactions are not executed. It requires Safe\{Core\} API running on the network.

## Configuration

### Use custom contracts

The Safe CLI comes with the official deterministic Safe Smart Account addresses deployed on multiple chains configured by default. You can edit the `safe_cli/safe_addresses.py` file if you want to use your own.

Be careful when modifying these addresses, as the funds in a Safe can get stuck if an invalid address is used when updating to an invalid Safe Master Copy.
