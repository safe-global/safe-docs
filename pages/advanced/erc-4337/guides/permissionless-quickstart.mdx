# Permissionless.js Quickstart Guide

In this guide, you will learn how to sponsor the deployment of an ERC-4337 Safe account and its user operations using [Pimlico](https://pimlico.io) infrastructure and the [permissionless](https://npmjs.com/permissionless) library.

This guide focuses high-level on deploying and using Safe accounts configured with the `Safe4337Module` enabled. For a more detailed guide that shows what happens under the hood, check the [Permissionless detailed guide](./permissionless-detailed.mdx).

Pimlico is one of the most popular ERC-4337 account abstraction infrastructure platforms, which provides a suite of tools and services to help build, deploy, and manage smart accounts on EVM-compatible chains.

`permissionless` is a TypeScript library focused on building with the ERC-4337 stack, including smart accounts, bundlers, paymasters, and user operations. Some of its core principles are providing a great developer experience and avoiding vendor lock-in by supporting different providers and ERC-4337 smart accounts, including Safe.

<Callout type='info' emoji='ℹ️'>
  If you are already building with the Safe\{Core\} SDK, you may want to follow the [Safe4337Pack guide](./safe-sdk.mdx) instead of integrating the `permissionless` library directly into your application.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).
- A [Pimlico account](https://dashboard.pimlico.io) and an API key.

## Install dependencies

Install [viem](https://npmjs.com/viem) and [permissionless](https://npmjs.com/permissionless) dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pnpm install viem permissionless
```

## Steps

<Steps>

  ### Imports

  These are all the imports required in the script we are building for this guide, which includes `permissionless` and `viem` packages.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  import 'dotenv/config'
  import { ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS_V06, createSmartAccountClient } from 'permissionless'
  import { signerToSafeSmartAccount } from 'permissionless/accounts'
  import {
    createPimlicoBundlerClient,
    createPimlicoPaymasterClient
  } from 'permissionless/clients/pimlico'
  import { createPublicClient, http, Hex, encodeFunctionData, parseEther } from 'viem'
  import { privateKeyToAccount } from 'viem/accounts'
  import { gnosis } from 'viem/chains'
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  ### Setup

  These are the constants that will be used in this guide. We have selected Gnosis as the chain, but other [supported networks](../../smart-account-supported-networks.mdx?module=Safe+4337+Module) can be used. We also need the Pimlico API key and a private key we will use for the owner of the Safe.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  // Network
  const chain = gnosis
  const chainName = 'gnosis'
  const SPONSORSHIP_POLICY_ID = '<insert_pimlico_sponsorship_policy_id>'

  // Keys
  const PIMLICO_API_KEY = process.env.PIMLICO_API_KEY
  const PRIVATE_KEY = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY as Hex
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  ### Create the signer

  First, we need a signer instance that will be the owner of the Safe account once it is deployed.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  const signer = privateKeyToAccount(PRIVATE_KEY as Hash)
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  ### Initialize the clients

  We need to create a few client instances to query the blockchain network and operate with Pimlico infrastructure.

  Firstly, we instantiate a standard `publicClient` instance for regular Ethereum RPC calls. To do this, we must first define the corresponding RPC URL, depending on our network.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  const publicClient = createPublicClient({
    transport: http(`https://rpc.ankr.com/${chainName}`)
  })
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  Secondly, we instantiate the `bundlerClient` using the Pimlico API `v1`, which is dedicated to the Bundler methods. This API requires a `PIMLICO_API_KEY` that we can get from their [dashboard](https://dashboard.pimlico.io/apikeys).

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  const bundlerClient = createPimlicoBundlerClient({
    transport: http(`https://api.pimlico.io/v1/${chainName}/rpc?add_balance_override&apikey=${PIMLICO_API_KEY}`),
    entryPoint: ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS_V06
  })
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  Lastly, we instantiate the `paymasterClient` using the Pimlico API `v2`, which is dedicated to the Paymaster methods and responsible for interacting with Pimlico's Verifying Paymaster endpoint and requesting sponsorship.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  const paymasterClient = createPimlicoPaymasterClient({
    transport: http(`https://api.pimlico.io/v2/${chainName}/rpc?add_balance_override&apikey=${PIMLICO_API_KEY}`),
    entryPoint: ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS_V06
  })
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  ### Fetch the gas price

  We fetch the current gas price values to add them later to our transaction.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  const gasPrices = await bundlerClient.getUserOperationGasPrice()
  ```

  ### Create the Safe account

  We can create a Safe account based on our `signer` address, the `entryPoint` address, an optional `saltNonce` that will affect the resulting address of the deployed Safe, and the `safeVersion` (that must be `1.4.1` or higher).

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  const safeAccount = await signerToSafeSmartAccount(publicClient, {
    entryPoint: ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS_V06,
    signer: signer,
    saltNonce: 0n, // Optional
    safeVersion: '1.4.1',
    address: '0x...' // Optional. Only for existing Safe accounts.
  })
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  The optional `address` parameter is only used when we already have a Safe account and want to initialize it. Deployments of new Safe accounts should remove this parameter.

  ### Create the Safe account client

  We need to create the smart account client with the following parameters:

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  const safeAccountClient = createSmartAccountClient({
    account: safeAccount,
    entryPoint: ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS_V06,
    chain: chain,
    bundlerTransport: http(`https://api.pimlico.io/v1/${chainName}/rpc?add_balance_override&apikey=${PIMLICO_API_KEY}`),
    middleware: {
      gasPrice: async () => (await bundlerClient.getUserOperationGasPrice()).fast,
      sponsorUserOperation: paymasterClient.sponsorUserOperation
    }
  })
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  In case we want to sponsor the transactions of this Safe using a Pimlico sponsorship id, we need to replace the `sponsorUserOperation` passed in the `middleware` property like this:

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  sponsorUserOperation: ({ userOperation }) => {
    return paymasterClient.sponsorUserOperation({
      userOperation,
      sponsorshipPolicyId: SPONSORSHIP_POLICY_ID
    })
  }
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

  ### Submit a transaction

  Finally, we call the `sendTransaction` method to submit our transaction.

  {/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  ```typescript
  const txHash = await safeAccountClient.sendTransaction({
    to: safeAccount.address,
    value: parseEther('0'),
    data: encodeFunctionData({
      abi: '',
      functionName: '',
      args: []
    }),
    maxFeePerGas: gasPrices.fast.maxFeePerGas,
    maxPriorityFeePerGas: gasPrices.fast.maxPriorityFeePerGas
  })
  ```

  {/* <!-- vale on --> */}

</Steps>

## Recap and further reading

This guide covered how to sponsor the deployment of a new ERC-4337 Safe and its user operations with Pimlico infrastructure using a Paymaster.

Feel free to try out other ideas and possibilities, as there are many more regarding:
- The deployment and initial setup of ERC-4337 accounts.
- The entity responsible for paying the transaction fees.
- The tokens used to pay the transaction fees.

Explore our [4337-gas-metering](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-modules/tree/main/examples/4337-gas-metering) repository on GitHub to see how most of these options work with Safe and notice the integrations with different providers like Alchemy, Gelato, and Pimlico.
