### `SafeWebAuthnSharedSignerConfigured`
```solidity
event SafeWebAuthnSharedSignerConfigured(bytes32 indexed publicKeyHash, uint256 x, uint256 y, P256.Verifiers verifiers)
```

Emitted when the shared signer is configured for an account.

Note that the configured account is not included in the event data. Since configuration
is done as a `DELEGATECALL`, the contract emitting the event is the configured account. This
is also why the event name is prefixed with `SafeWebAuthnSharedSigner`, in order to avoid
event `topic0` collisions with other contracts (seeing as "configured" is a common term).


Parameters:

| :------------ | :------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| publicKeyHash | bytes32        | The Keccak-256 hash of the public key coordinates.  |
| x             | uint256        | The x-coordinate of the public key.                 |
| y             | uint256        | The y-coordinate of the public key.                 |
| verifiers     | P256.Verifiers | The P-256 verifiers to use.                         |
