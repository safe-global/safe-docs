These sections below should be edited to shorten them and can then be used in the cards.

## Safe\{Core\} AA SDK

The [Safe\{Core\} Account Abstraction SDK](./sdk-overview.md) is a set of developer kits that help integrate Safe with different external service providers. The SDK offers developers the ability to abstract the complexity that comes with operating a smart contract account.

This section in the documentation has relevant information and tutorials on the SDK kits and how to integrate them.

## Safe\{Core\} API

The [Safe\{Core\} API](./api-supported-networks.md) refers to all the Safe infrastructure needed to power interfaces with all Safe account related information. This includes the Safe Transaction Service, Safe Events Service, etc.

This section in the documentation has information related to the services architecture.
