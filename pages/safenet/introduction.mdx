## Why Safenet?

Safenet's vision is to move the world's GDP on-chain. To achieve this, Safenet addresses several significant challenges the blockchain ecosystem faces:

* **Fragmentation**: Different Layer 1 and Layer 2 solutions form isolated ecosystems, and blockchains are not yet fully integrated with traditional financial networks.
* **Latency**: Cross-chain transactions face delays due to bridging mechanisms and varying block times.
* **Complexity**: Security concerns and complicated user experiences hinder mainstream adoption.
* **Interoperability**: Blockchains are not natively compatible with the traditional financial system. 

## What is Safenet?

Notably, Safenet is not a blockchain or layer 2 nor a bridge.

Safenet is a **transaction processing network** similar to Visa or SWIFT.

This means:

* **Transaction**: A Safenet transaction is a user-initiated action that moves assets across blockchains. A Safenet transaction will usually involve multiple traditional blockchain transactions.
At the very core of Safenet is the Safenet transaction. A Safenet transaction is a user-initiated action that moves funds. 
* **Processing**: A Safenet transaction is different to a traditional blockchain transaction because it is processed. It is processed, which means it can include safety guarantees, additional security checks or can be settled over multiple blockchains.
* **Network**: Safenet is not one centralized entity, but a network of decentralized operators. These operators guarantee the security of the network by keeping each other in check.

It's an *optimistic, validity-proof transaction processing network* anchored on the Ethereum mainnet (these concepts will be explained in the introduction). 
It's designed to work on top of any existing or future chains and even connects on-chain and off-chain networks like Visa or centralized exchanges.
It separates transaction fulfillment from settlement, allowing users to interact with any supported blockchain protocol.
It uses [optimistic validity proofs](./optimistic-validity-proof.mdx) to ensure every transaction adheres to a set of security [guarantees](./concepts/guarantee.mdx).

By offloading security and cross-chain bridging responsibilities to a network of processors, validators, and liquidity providers, Safenet eliminates the complexity of cross-chain interactions. Users gain the ability to transact across blockchains with unprecedented speed and securityâ€”without needing to worry about the underlying infrastructure.

## What does Safenet enable?

Safenet enables users to spend their funds on any supported blockchain without additional delays and without traditional bridging.
It ensures that users fully control their assets and the level of transaction protection they desire.

Behind the scenes, Safenet handles the settlement by coordinating funds from the various blockchains where the user holds assets.

For the user, all they experience is a seamless transaction as fast as the blockchain mines blocks.
