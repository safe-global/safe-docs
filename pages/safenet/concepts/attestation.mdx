# Attestation

This document or proof confirms the completion and validity of a [transaction's](../safenet-transaction.mdx) [settlement](../concepts/settlement.mdx). 
It serves as a cryptographic proof that can be used to verify the execution and correctness of actions taken within the Safenet ecosystem.

The [processor](../core-components/processor.mdx) has to provide the attestation when a [settlement](../concepts/settlement.mdx) is [challenged](challenge.mdx) by a [validator](../core-components/validator.mdx). 
The processor can voluntarily provide the attestation with the settlement request to ensure that the settlement is processed directly.

An attestation has to include proof that all guarantees have been met.
