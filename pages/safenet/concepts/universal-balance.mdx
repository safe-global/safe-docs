# Universal Balance

Universal Balance in Safenet refers to a unified account balance across multiple supported [blockchains](../chains.mdx). 
It allows users to interact with any chain without manually bridging assets between chains.

Rather than holding separate balances on each chain, the Universal Balance aggregates the user's funds across all chains and manages liquidity dynamically. 
This enables chain abstraction, with the user spending from a single balance while the underlying system handles the complexities of settling funds on different chains.

The Universal Balance simplifies user experience by removing the need for manual asset transfers and allowing instant liquidity access across chains.
