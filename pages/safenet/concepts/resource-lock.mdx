# Resource lock 

The Resource Lock is a mechanism in Safenet that ensures the availability of user funds for transactions by locking a portion of the [End User's](../core-components/end-user.mdx) assets. 
This lock guarantees that sufficient resources are set aside to [settle](./settlement.mdx) transactions securely and efficiently.

The resource lock is issued on the funds on the debit [chain](../chains.mdx) before the fulfillment is done on the spend chain. The lock is maintained until the transaction is settled on the debit chain.

The [processor](../core-components/processor.mdx) manages the resource lock, ensuring that no transactions can move funds out of the End User's Safe Smart Account on the debit chain while the resource lock is in effect.
