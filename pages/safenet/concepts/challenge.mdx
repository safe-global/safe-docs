# Challenge

A validator can challenge the settlement request of a processor. 
In this case, the processor has to provide an attestation to prove the validity of the transaction. 
If the processor fails to provide the attestation, the settlement process is considered invalid, and the validator can slash the processor's stake to reimburse the liquidity provider.
