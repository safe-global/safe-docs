# Challenge

A [validator](../core-components/validator.mdx) can challenge the [settlement](./settlement.mdx) request of a [processor](../core-components/processor.mdx). 
In this case, the processor has to provide an [attestation](./attestation.mdx) to prove the validity of the [transaction](../safenet-transaction.mdx). 
If the processor fails to provide the attestation, the settlement process is considered invalid, and the validator can slash the processor's stake to reimburse the [liquidity provider](../core-components/liquidity-provider.mdx).
