# Chains

- **Home Chain:** the chain for the core Safenet contracts that are managed by the Safe DAO and where validity proofs are finalized. For all intents and purposes, this is Ethereum Mainnet.
- **Spend Chain:** the chain where the Safenet action executes. In particular, assets required for executing the blockchain transaction are fronted as part of the *action* by the liquidity provider on the spend chain.
- **Debit Chain:** the chain where funds owed by the Safenet account to the liquidity provider (in exchange for fronting those funds on the *spend chain*) are debited as part of a Safenet settlement.
