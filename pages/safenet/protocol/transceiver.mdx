# Transceiver

The Transceiver is a bridge adapter used within Safenet to ensure that the [guarantee engine](./guarantee-engine.mdx) remains bridge-agnostic. 
It enables seamless cross-chain communication, allowing the guarantee engine to interact with multiple blockchains. 

Transceivers are registered by the [SafeDAO](./safe-dao.mdx) within the [guarantee engine](./guarantee-engine.mdx) to support interoperability across different chains and [guarantee implementations](./guarantee-implementation.mdx).
