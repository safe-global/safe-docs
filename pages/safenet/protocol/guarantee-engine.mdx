# Guarantee engine

The Guarantee Engine is a smart contract deployed on the Ethereum Mainnet (the [home chain](../chains.mdx)) that is responsible for issuing [guarantees](../concepts/guarantee.mdx) during challenge flows. 

It is designed to remain as general as possible, managing a list of [guarantee implementations](./guarantee-implementation.mdx) that verify the correctness of [settlements](../concepts/settlement.mdx). 
The guarantee engine works in tandem with the [Transciever](./transceiver.mdx) contracts, which act as bridge adapters, ensuring compatibility across different chains. 

The [SafeDAO](./safe-dao.mdx) owns and governs the guarantee engine, making it the central authority for configuring and managing guarantees.
