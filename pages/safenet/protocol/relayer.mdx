# Relayer

The Relayer is the externally owned account (EOA) that serves as the transaction originator for Safenet transactions. 
It is responsible for fronting the gas costs associated with executing transactions. 

The processor reimburses the relayer for these gas fees. While the exact reimbursement mechanism is not covered in this document, it ensures that relayers are compensated for their role in transaction execution.
