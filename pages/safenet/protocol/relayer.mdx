# Relayer

The Relayer is the externally owned account (EOA) that serves as the transaction originator for [Safenet transactions](../safenet-transaction.mdx). 
It is responsible for fronting the gas costs associated with executing transactions.

The [processor](../core-components/processor.mdx) reimburses the Relayer for these gas fees. 
While this document does not cover the exact reimbursement mechanism, it ensures that relayers are compensated for their role in transaction execution.
