# Guard

The Guard is a smart contract deployed on every chain in Safenet. It is a classic [Safe Guard](./../../advanced/smart-account-guards.mdx). 
It functions as a security mechanism that verifies whether a transaction has been co-signed by the [processor](../core-components/processor.mdx). 

The Guard safeguards against fraudulent or unauthorized [transactions](../safenet-transaction.mdx), providing an additional layer of security to the Safenet protocol.
It also ensures that only authorized [processors](../core-components/processor.mdx) can initiate and approve transactions, maintaining the system's integrity.
