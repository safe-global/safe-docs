# Guarantee Implementation

A Guarantee Implementation is a smart contract that is registered with the [guarantee engine](./guarantee-engine.mdx). 
It defines the rules and semantics for how a [guarantee](./guarantee.mdx) should be applied and validated. 

These implementations can vary in terms of configuration, such as whether guarantees are enabled or disabled by default or whether certain guarantees are required for particular flows. 
The flexibility of the guarantee implementation allows Safenet to support a range of use cases and transaction types.
