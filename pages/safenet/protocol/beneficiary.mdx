# Beneficiary 

The Beneficiary refers to the account receiving the debited funds during the [settlement](../concepts/settlement.mdx) process. 
In more complex scenarios, the [processor](../core-components/processor.mdx) may collect all debited funds and distribute them to cover processor fees, [liquidity provider](../core-components/liquidity-provider.mdx) reimbursements, and [relayer](./relayer.mdx) compensation.
