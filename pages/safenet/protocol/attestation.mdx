# Attestation

This document or proof confirms the completion and validity of a [transaction's](../safenet-transaction.mdx) [settlement](../concepts/settlement.mdx). 
It serves as a cryptographic proof that can be used to verify the execution and correctness of actions taken within the Safenet ecosystem.

The [processor](../core-components/processor.mdx) has to provide the attestation when a [settlement](../concepts/settlement.mdx) is requested. 
The processor can voluntarily provide the [attestation](./attestation.mdx) with the settlement request, to ensure that the settlement is processed directly.
