# Guarantee

A Guarantee is a data message issued by the [guarantee engine](./guarantee-engine.mdx). 
It represents the assurance provided for a [transaction](../safenet-transaction.mdx) or [settlement](../concepts/settlement.mdx). 
The guarantee is validated by the associated [guarantee implementation](./guarantee-implementation.mdx). 

Unlike atomic operations proven in a single Ethereum transaction, guarantees in Safenet are not necessarily atomic. 
This allows for more complex guarantees, such as nested optimistic validity zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, which can be used to ensure the validity of transactions in a more scalable and secure manner.
