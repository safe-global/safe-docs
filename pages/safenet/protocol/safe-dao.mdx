# Safe DAO

The Safe DAO is the governing body responsible for the ownership and configuration of the [guarantee engine](./guarantee-engine.mdx) and other parts of Safenet. 
It is the only entity that can modify Safenet's configurations via the guarantee engine. 
These configurations are managed on [Ethereum Mainnet](../chains.mdx) and can be updated based on the ecosystem's evolving needs. 

The Safe DAO ensures that Safenet operates decentralized and flexible, providing the necessary oversight for secure and efficient cross-chain operations.
