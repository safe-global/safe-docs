# Entry Point

The Entry Point is a smart contract deployed on every supported [chain](../chains.mdx). 
It is distinct from the [ERC-4337](../../advanced/erc-4337/overview.mdx) entry point contract and is the primary gateway for [Safenet transactions](../safenet-transaction.mdx). 
When the [processor](../core-components/processor.mdx) relays transactions, the entry point ensures on-chain bookkeeping and cross-chain communication. 

It executes Safe transactions signed by the owners and co-signed by the processor, meaning no further authentication is required. 

For on-chain bookkeeping, minimal data is stored in the form of storage and events, which validators use to verify the correctness of [settlements](../concepts/settlement.mdx).
If validity proofs are needed, information about executed Safenet transactions can be sent to the home chain to facilitate challenge resolution. 
This requires additional authentication, as configured by the [Safe DAO](./safe-dao.mdx).
