# Entry Point

* Smart Contract
* Deployed once on every chain
* Not to be confused with 4337 entry point contract
* Called by processor when relaying Safenet transactions on the spend chain
* Ensures on-chain bookkeeping
* Responsible for cross-chain communication. 
* Executes Safe transactions that are signed by the owners (thus doesn't require further authentication)
* Needs additional authentication for bridging to the home chain (but this is configured on the home chain and can be managed by the Safe DAO)
* Stores minimal data with storage and events. This data is used by `Validators` to check settlements. 


TODO: If a validity proof is needed, information about executed Safenet transactions can be sent to the home chain for the challenge resolution.
