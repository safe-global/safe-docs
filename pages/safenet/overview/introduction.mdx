## Why Safenet?

Blockchains have the potential to become the global settlement layer for society—enabling seamless coordination, transactions, and a more interconnected world. Achieving this vision means moving the world’s entire economy (i.e., GDP) on-chain.

However, several significant challenges need to be addressed:

* **Fragmentation**: Different Layer 1 and Layer 2 solutions form isolated ecosystems, and blockchains are not yet fully integrated with traditional financial networks.
* **Latency**: Cross-chain transactions face delays due to bridging mechanisms and varying block times.
* **Complexity**: Security concerns and complicated user experiences hinder mainstream adoption.

## What is Safenet?

Safenet is not just another Layer 2 solution or rollup, nor is it tied to any specific messaging protocol. Instead, Safenet is a validator-secured transaction processing network anchored on Ethereum mainnet. It separates transaction fulfillment from settlement, allowing users to interact with any supported blockchain protocol.

By offloading security and cross-chain bridging responsibilities to a network of processors, validators, and liquidity providers, Safenet eliminates the complexity of cross-chain interactions. Users gain the ability to transact across blockchains with unprecedented speed and security—without needing to worry about the underlying infrastructure.

## What does Safenet enable?

Safenet enables users to spend their funds on any supported blockchain without the need for traditional bridging. It ensures that users remain in full control of their assets while fronting the transaction on the desired chain. Behind the scenes, Safenet handles the settlement by coordinating funds from the various blockchains where the user holds assets.

For the user, all they experience is a seamless, lightning-fast transaction—without the complexity of cross-chain processes.
