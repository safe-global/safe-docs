# Safenet Architecture

Safenet is a hybrid network combining on-chain smart contracts across multiple blockchains and rollups, alongside a decentralized network of off-chain actors that process transactions across these chains.

Safenet is composed of the following key components:

* **Safe Smart Accounts**: Each Safenet Account is spread across multiple blockchains, with one Safe Smart Account per chain. 
Every Safenet Account is anchored by a Safe Smart Account deployed on Ethereum mainnet.
* **Safenet Smart Contracts**: These contracts are deployed on every supported chain, with Ethereum mainnet serving as the primary hub for configuration and coordination.
* **Decentralized off-chain actors**: Safenet introduces several key roles for off-chain transaction processing:
    * **Processors and Validators**: Handle the heavy lifting of processing, signing, and validating transactions off-chain.
    * **Liquidity Providers**: Supply liquidity on-chain to facilitate seamless transactions across different blockchains.
* **External Bridges**: External bridges are only used if a validator challenges a Safenet transaction.
