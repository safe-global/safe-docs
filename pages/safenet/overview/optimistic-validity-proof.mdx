# Optimistic Validity Proof

Optimistic validity proofs are the core concept of Safenet that enable speed and convenience of the centralized world with the security and self-custody of the decentralized world.


* A Safenet transaction's fulfillment is always fast and gas-efficient, because neither the processor nor the liquidity provider have an incentive to send out funds to a user that they would not receive back (and the procosser does not want to loose its stakes).
* The settlement is slightly slower, as it has a challenge delay, in which a validator can challenge the settlement request. 
It is gas-efficient, as the processor does not have to send a proof of validity initially (but is free to do so).
Only when a validator challenges the settlement request, the processor has to send a proof of validity. 
The proof has to be send from the spend chain to the debit chain, which is costly and slow, as the proccsor has to use cross-chain bridges.

Safenet optimistically assumes a transaction is valid, which will make the transaction fast and gas-efficient. A processor does not have to proof the validity of a transaction to execute it.

Only when the transaction is challenged, the validity of the transaction has to be proofen, the validity of the transaction is checked, which is slow and costs more gas.

Optimistic validity proofs work similarly to [slashing](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/rewards-and-penalties/#slashing) in proof-of-stake networks. 


A transaction by a processors is considered valid by default. 
The processor does not have to send a proof of validity.
A validator can challenge the validity of a transaction. 
The validator has to post some collateral with the challenge, that is send to the processor, if the transaction is valid.
The processor has to send a proof of validity, if the transaction is challenged.
Sending a proof of validity is costly, as it requires to check the validity of the transaction sending the proof over a bridge from the spend chain to the debit chain.
The processors can also send a proof of validity with the settlement request. 

These are the economic incentives for the different actors:

* The processor has an incentive to process transactions correctly, as they risk to loose funds, when they process invalid transactions. 
* The liquidity provider is secured by the stake of the processor.
* The validator has an incentive to challenge invalid transactions, as they can earn a fee. They have an incentive not to challenge valid transactions, as they risk to loose funds, when the transaction is valid.
