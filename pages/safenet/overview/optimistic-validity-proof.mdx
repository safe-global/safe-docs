# Optimistic Validity Proof

A core concept of Safenet are optimistic validity proofs.
They enable the secure and efficient processing of Safenet transactions.
At a Safenet transaction, the user never risks losing funds due to an error.
Only Safenet actors risk to loose funds, when an error occurs. 

The users' funds are always safe.

Optimistic validity proofs 

When a processors signs a Safenet transaction as valid, the user action happens instantly.
As the processors fronted the transaction, they risk to loose funds, when the transaction is invalid. 
The user does not risk to loose funds. 
The only risk the user takes, is that the transaction is not possible. When the processors pre-funds a invalid transcaction, the user will end up with double the amount of funds.


* optimistically assume settlements are valid, but provide a mechanism for challenging them, where the onus of proof is on the processor. 
The processor must prove correctness if challenged (as opposed to optimistic fraud proofs, where the challenger must prove incorrectness).
