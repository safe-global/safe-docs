# Safenet Transaction

To provide a high-level overview of Safenet, this page describes the flow of a Safenet transaction.
Further details on the components and roles involved in a Safenet transaction are covered in the [Core Components](../core-components/processor.mdx) section.

A Safenet transaction consists of multiple parts:

1. The users sign a Safenet transaction. 
This includes the regular Safe transaction, that need to be signed by a enough owners of the Safe.
2. As the Safenet guard needs to green-light every transaction of the Smart Accounts, one or multiple `processors` check the transaction. 
These checks can include checking if the funds are available on any of the chains where the Safenet account has Safe Smart Accounts, or it can check other security properties.
When the `processors` agree that the transaction is valid, they sign the transaction.
3. The processor sends the transaction and the signatures from step 1. and 2. to the `Relayer`.
4. The `Relayer` executes the transaction.
5. While executing the Safenet transaction, multiple things happen:
    1. The `liquidity provider` send funds to the Safe Smart Account on the spend chain.
    2. The initial Safe transaction is executed. The Safe guard will verify the signature provided by the `processors`.
    3. When everything is correct, the Safe Smart Account can execute the desired transaction on the spend chain, with the funds being available.
6. A resource lock is issued on the Safe Smart Account on the debit chain, to ensure that the liquidity provider gets reimbursed.
7. The processor requests a [settlement](../concepts/settlement.mdx) on the debit chain. The settlement request has a challenge delay, in which any `validator` can challenge the settlement request.
8. If no `validator` challenges the settlement request, the settlement is executed. The liquidity provider receives funds from the Safe Smart Account on the debit chain, and the Safe Smart Account is unlocked.
