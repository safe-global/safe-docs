# Optimistic Validity Proof

Optimistic validity proofs are the core concept of Safenet, which enables the centralized world's speed and convenience with the decentralized world's security and self-custody.

They ensure that transactions are fast and gas-efficient in the vast majority of cases (the happy path) while still providing security [guarantees](./concepts/guarantee.mdx). 
Only in rare dispute cases does the system return to a slow and gas-intense process.

Optimistic validity proofs work similarly to [slashing](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/rewards-and-penalties/#slashing) in proof-of-stake networks.
The processors risk losing their stake or pre-funded funds when they process invalid transactions.
The validator risks losing their collateral when they challenge valid transactions.

## Effects on transaction speed and gas efficiency

* A [Safenet transaction's](./safenet-transaction.mdx) **fulfillment is always fast and gas-efficient**, because neither the [processor](./core-components/processor.mdx) nor the [liquidity provider](./core-components/liquidity-provider.mdx) have the incentive to send out funds to a user that they would not receive back (and the processor does not want to lose its stakes).
* The **[settlement](./concepts/settlement.mdx) is gas-efficient but slightly slower**, as it has a [challenge](./concepts/challenge.mdx) delay, in which a [validator](./core-components/validator.mdx) can challenge the settlement request. 
It is gas-efficient, as the processor does not have to send a correctness proof ([attestation](./concepts/attestation.mdx)) initially (but is free to do so).
* Only a **challenged settlement is gas-intense and slow**. When a validator challenges the settlement request, the processor has to send an attestation. 
The attestation has to be sent from the spend chain to the debit chain with a cross-chain bridge, which is costly and slow.

## Economic incentives

Optimistic validity proofs build on the following economic incentives:

* The processor has an incentive to process transactions correctly, as they risk losing funds when they process invalid transactions. 
* The stake of the processor secures the liquidity provider.
* The validator has an incentive to challenge invalid transactions, as they can earn a fee. 
They have an incentive not to challenge valid transactions, as they risk losing funds if the transaction is valid.
