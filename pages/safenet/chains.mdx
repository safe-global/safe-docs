# Chains

Safenet provides a unified user experience over multiple blockchains. 
A Safenet transaction can happen on one or multiple chains.
In a [Safenet transaction](./safenet-transaction.mdx), chains can take up the following roles:

- **Spend Chain:** This is where the user wants to execute an action.
Safenet makes sure the required funds are available instantly on the spend chain.
Another name is *target chain*.
- **Debit Chain:** This is where a user owns the required assets for the action.
The user does not have to select the debit chain, as Safenet finds the required funds over all connects chains.
Another name is *source chain*.
- **Home Chain:** Safenet uses Ethereum Mainnet as the home chain for configuration and coordination.
For example, the configurable set of safety guarantees for a user's Safenet account is stored on Ethereum Mainnet.
