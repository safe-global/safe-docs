# Transaction Service

The Transaction Service operates across all Safe-supported [chains](../chains.mdx) and indexes Safe accounts and transactions. 
In Safenet, it functions as a **shared mempool**, recording transactions that the [processor](./processor.mdx) needs to execute.

The Event Service works with the Transaction Service, triggering WebHooks for specific Safe events.
