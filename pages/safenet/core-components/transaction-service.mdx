# Transaction Service

The Transaction Service is a service available on all chains supported by Safe used to record and index Safe accounts and transactions. In the context of Safenet, the Transaction Service is used as a **shared mempool** to record transactions that need to be executed by the Processor.

The Event Service ****works alongside the Transaction Service(s) to trigger WebHooks when some particular Safe events happen.
