# Processors

The Processor is a service that executes transactions on behalf of the End User when specific conditions are met:

* The [End User](./end-user.mdx) is registered with Safenet (locking assets through a Guard or co-signing mechanism).
* The End User has sufficient locked funds to settle transactions across one or more chains.
* The End User's guarantees are validated.
* The Processor has enough liquidity to pre-fund the End User's account.

Processors must maintain a Safe account on all supported chains to manage liquidity for the End User.

After execution, the Processor handles the [settlements](../concepts/settlement.mdx) by initiating an optimistic settlement process. 
This process, subject to delay, can be challenged by a [Validator](./validator.mdx). 
The Processor refunds itself or the liquidity provider by pulling funds from the End User's account.
