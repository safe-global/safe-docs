# Processors

The Processor is a service that executes [transactions](../safenet-transaction.mdx) on behalf of the End User when specific conditions are met:

* The [End User](./end-user.mdx) is registered with Safenet (locking assets through a [Guard](../protocol/guard.mdx) or co-signing mechanism).
* The End User has sufficient locked funds to settle transactions across one or more [chains](../chains.mdx).
* The End User's [guarantees](../protocol/guarantee.mdx) are validated.
* The Processor has enough liquidity to pre-fund the End User's account.

Processors must maintain a Safe account on all supported chains to manage liquidity for the End User.

After execution, the Processor handles the [settlements](../concepts/settlement.mdx) by initiating an optimistic settlement process. 
This process, subject to delay, can be [challenged](../concepts/challenge.mdx) by a [Validator](./validator.mdx). 
The Processor refunds itself or the [liquidity provider](./liquidity-provider.mdx) by pulling funds from the End User's account.
