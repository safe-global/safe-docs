# Processors

The Processor represents a service that executes user’s signed transactions on behalf of the End User if certain conditions are met:

- The End User is registered to Safenet (locking his assets through a Guard / co-signing mechanism)
- The End User has enough funds locked to settle the transactions on one or more chains
- The guarantees enabled by the End User have passed
- The Processor has enough liquidity available to pre-fund the user’s account


The Processor must have a Safe account available on all supported chains to handle liquidity provisioning to the End User

The Processor takes care of the settlements of the transaction after execution by initiating an optimistic process (with delay) that can be challenged by a Validator. The settlement consists in pulling out funds from the End User account to refund himself.
