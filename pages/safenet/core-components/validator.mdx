# Validator

The Validator ensures that the [Processor](./processor.mdx) correctly [settles](../concepts/settlement.mdx) transactions as per the guarantees signed by the [End User](./end-user.mdx). 
If a settlement is invalid or fraudulent, the Validator can challenge it, initiating a dispute that requires the Processor to [prove](../concepts/attestation.mdx) the transaction's validity.
