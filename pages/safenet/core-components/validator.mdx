# Validator

The Validator ensures that the [Processor](./processor.mdx) correctly settles transactions as per the guarantees signed by the [End User](./end-user.mdx). 
If a settlement is invalid or fraudulent, the Validator can challenge it, initiating a dispute that requires the Processor to prove the transaction's validity.
