# Safenet Protocol

The Safenet Protocol represents automated Smart-Contracts to enable the different parties to communicate in a trustless way. Both Smart-Contract variable states and events can be used as communication channels.

The Safenet Protocol is described in detail in the section [Safenet Protocol](/../protocol).
