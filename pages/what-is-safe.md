Safe is at the forefront of modular smart account infrastructure, paving the way for developers to create various applications and wallets.

## Safe\{Core\} AA SDK

The [Safe\{Core\} Account Abstraction SDK](./sdk-overview.md) is a set of developer kits that help integrate Safe with different external service providers. The SDK offers developers the ability to abstract the complexity that comes with operating a smart contract account.

This section in the documentation has relevant information and tutorials on the SDK kits and how to integrate them.

## Safe\{Core\} API

The [Safe\{Core\} API](./api-supported-networks.md) refers to all the Safe infrastructure needed to power interfaces with all Safe account related information. This includes the Safe Transaction Service, Safe Events Service, etc.
