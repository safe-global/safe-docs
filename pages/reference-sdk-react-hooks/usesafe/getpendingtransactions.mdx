### `data`

- **Type**: [`SafeMultisigTransaction[]`](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-core-sdk/blob/dc602ed126cc210048b278b2372c0979ee4be62b/packages/types-kit/src/types.ts#L216C1-L247C2)
- **Default**: `undefined`

The last successfully resolved data for the query.

### `dataUpdatedAt`

- **Type**: `number`

The timestamp for when the query most recently returned the `status` as `'success'`.

### `error`

- **Type**: `null | TError`
- **Default**: `null`

The error object for the query, if an error was thrown.

### `errorUpdatedAt`

- **Type**: `number`

The timestamp for when the query most recently returned the `status` as `'error'`.

### `errorUpdateCount`

- **Type**: `number`

The sum of all errors.

### `failureCount`

- **Type**: `number`

The failure count for the query.

Incremented every time the query fails.

Reset to `0` when the query succeeds.

### `failureReason`

- **Type**: `null | TError`

The failure reason for the query retry.

Reset to `null` when the query succeeds.

### `fetchStatus`

- **Type**: `'fetching' | 'idle' | 'paused'`

`fetching` Is true whenever the `queryFn` is executing, which includes initial pending as well as background refetches.

`paused` The query wanted to fetch, but has been paused.

`idle` The query is not fetching.

See [Network Mode](https://tanstack.com/query/v5/docs/framework/react/guides/network-mode) for more information.

### `isError` / `isPending` / `isSuccess`

- **Type**: `boolean`

The boolean variables derived from `status`.

### `isFetched`

- **Type**: `boolean`

Will be true if the query has been fetched.

### `isFetchedAfterMount`

- **Type**: `boolean`

Will be `true` if the query has been fetched after the component mounted.

This property can be used to not show any previously cached data.

### `isFetching` / `isPaused`

- **Type**: `boolean`

The boolean variables derived from `fetchStatus`.

### `isLoading`

- **Type**: `boolean`

Is `true` whenever the first fetch for a query is in-flight.

Is the same as `isFetching && !isPending`.

### `isLoadingError`

- **Type**: `boolean`

Will be `true` if the query failed while fetching for the first time.

### `isPlaceholderData`

- **Type**: `boolean`

Will be `true` if the data shown is the placeholder data.

### `isRefetchError`

- **Type**: `boolean`

Will be `true` if the query failed while refetching.

### `isRefetching`

- **Type**: `boolean`

Is `true` whenever a background refetch is in-flight, which does not include initial `'pending'`.

Is the same as `isFetching && !isPending`.

### `isStale`

- **Type**: `boolean`

Will be `true` if the data in the cache is invalidated or if the data is older than the given `staleTime`.

### `refetch`

- **Type**: `(options: { throwOnError: boolean, cancelRefetch: boolean }) => Promise<UseQueryResult>`

A function to manually refetch the query.

- `throwOnError`
  - When set to `true`, an error will be thrown if the query fails.
  - When set to `false`, an error will be logged if the query fails.
- `cancelRefetch`
  - When set to `true`, a currently running request will be cancelled before a new request is made.
  - When set to `false`, no refetch will be made if there is already a request running.
  - Defaults to `true`

### `status`

- **Type**: `'error' | 'pending' | 'success'`

`pending` if there's no cached data and no query attempt was finished yet.

`error` if the query attempt resulted in an error. The corresponding `error` property has the error received from the attempted fetch.

`success` if the query has received a response with no errors and is ready to display its data. The corresponding `data` property on the query is the data received from the successful fetch or if the query's `enabled` property is set to `false` and has not been fetched yet `data` is the first `initialData` supplied to the query on initialization.
