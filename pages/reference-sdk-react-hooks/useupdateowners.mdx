    import App from './App.tsx  '

    const config = createConfig({
      chain: sepolia,
      provider,
      signer,
      safeAddress: '0x...'
    })

    const root = document.getElementById('root')
    
    ReactDOM.createRoot(root).render(
      <SafeProvider config={config}>
        <App />
      </SafeProvider>

## Caveats

The `addOwner`, `addOwnerAsync`, `removeOwner`, `removeOwnerAsync`, `swapOwner` and `swapOwnerAsync` methods are used to send a transaction to update the owners of a Safe account. They cover transaction flows that you would typically need to implement yourself if you're using a more advanced kit, such as the `protocol-kit` in conjunction with the `api-kit`.

The owners can only be updated by the existing owners of the Safe and only if the Safe account is already deployed (you are using `safeAddress` or the `safeOptions` counterfactual address prediction derives an existing Safe account). If being used for a Safe account that has not been deployed yet, the methods will fail before sending the transaction.

We can distinguish two main cases when using these methods:

- In the case the Safe is a multisig account (more than one owner and threshold greater than 1), the methods will propose a transaction to update the owners. The transaction is not sent to the blockchain immediately, but is stored in our Transaction Service. This is because you need more signatures than just the one for the `signer` used to create the client.
- In the case the Safe is a single-owner account (threshold equal to 1), the transaction to update the owners is sent directly to the blockchain without being stored in our services, as it is not necessary.
