# `execTransaction`

Executes a Safe transaction to `to` with `value` (native currency) and pays `gasPrice` \* `gasLimit` in `gasToken` token to `refundReceiver`.

<Callout type='warning'>
  The fees are always transferred, even if the user transaction fails. This
  method doesn't perform any sanity check of the transaction, such as if the
  contract at `to` address has code or not. It is the responsibility of the
  caller to perform such checks.
</Callout>

## Usage

{/* <!-- vale off --> */}

  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```solidity
    interface ISafe {
        function execTransaction(
            address to,
            uint256 value,
