# `setGuard`

Set Transaction Guard `guard` that checks transactions before execution.

<Callout type='warning'>This action can only be done via a Safe transaction.</Callout>
<Callout type='error' emoji='ðŸš¨'>
  Since a guard has the full power to block Safe transaction executions, a broken
  guard can cause a denial of service for the Safe. Make sure to carefully audit
  the guard code and design recovery mechanisms.
</Callout>
