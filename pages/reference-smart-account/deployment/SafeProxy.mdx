# SafeProxy

Users save deployment gas cost by deploying a `SafeProxy` contract instead of a deploying complete bytecode of Smart Account and associated contracts. The `SafeProxy` delegates all calls to a singleton contract, whose address is stored at `slot(0)` of the proxy contract. This means that the proxy contract itself is lightweight and inexpensive to deploy, while the actual logic is handled by the singleton contract.

For more information on how the proxy is deployed and the factors that determine the address of the proxy, see the `SafeProxyFactory`.
