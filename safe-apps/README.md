# Safe Apps SDK

The Safe Apps SDK allow developers to build their dApps right into the Safe{Wallet}. Turn your Dapp into an HTML iframe component that can be accessed through the Safe. We are providing extensive developer tooling to make it easy to create, test and integrate Safe Apps into the Safe. This includes an unique design system, reusable components and a Safe App SDK that facilitates the Safe App <> Safe communication.

## Packages

You can find several packages on [our developer tools](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-apps-sdk) to make it easier to integrate third-party applications (Safe Apps) with [Safe](https://app.safe.global). Check the following diagram to see which package is more convenient for you:
