# Relay Kit

The [Relay Kit](https://github.com/safe-global/account-abstraction-sdk/tree/main/packages/relay-kit) allows users to pay transaction fees (gas fees) using the native blockchain token or ERC-20 tokens. This allows you to pay gas fees using any ERC-20 token in your Safe, even if you don't have ETH.

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

1. [Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm#using-a-node-version-manager-to-install-nodejs-and-npm).
2. Have a Safe where only 1 signature is needed to execute transactions.
3. For using Gelato 1Balance [you will need an API key](https://docs.gelato.network/developer-services/relay/payment-and-fees/1balance).

### Install dependencies

```bash
yarn add @safe-global/relay-kit
```

### How to use

Currently, the Relay Kit is only compatible with the [Gelato relay](https://docs.gelato.network/developer-services/relay). There are 2 ways to use the Gelato relay:
1.  [Gelato SyncFee](https://docs.gelato.network/developer-services/relay/quick-start/callwithsyncfee)
2. [Gelato 1Balance](https://docs.gelato.network/developer-services/relay/payment-and-fees/1balance)

#### Gelato SyncFee

[Gelato SyncFee](https://docs.gelato.network/developer-services/relay/quick-start/callwithsyncfee) is one of the most straightforward ways to use relaying. Gelato SyncFee allows you to execute a transaction and pay the gas fees directly with funds in your Safe, even if you don't have ETH or the native blockchain token.

```typescript
import { GelatoRelayAdapter } from '@safe-global/relay-kit'

const relayAdapter = new GelatoRelayAdapter()

relayAdapter.relayTransaction({
  target: '0x...', // the Safe address
  encodedTransaction: '0x...', // Encoded Safe transaction data
  chainId: 5
})
```

#### Gelato 1Balance

[Gelato 1Balance](https://docs.gelato.network/developer-services/relay/payment-and-fees/1balance) allows you to execute transactions using a prepaid deposit. This can be used to sponsor transactions to other Safes or even to use a deposit on Polygon to pay the fees for a wallet on another chain.

```typescript
import { GelatoRelayAdapter, MetaTransactionOptions } from '@safe-global/relay-kit'

const relayAdapter = new GelatoRelayAdapter(GELATO_RELAY_API_KEY)

const options: MetaTransactionOptions = {
  isSponsored: true // This parameter is mandatory to use the 1Balance method
}
relayAdapter.relayTransaction({
  target: '0x...', // the Safe address
  encodedTransaction: '0x...', // Encoded Safe transaction data
  chainId: 5,
  options
})
```
