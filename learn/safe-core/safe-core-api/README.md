# Safe{Core} API

The [Safe{Core} API](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-transaction-service) allows users to query information about Safe accounts such as:

1. Pending and confirmed transactions sent via Safe contracts
2. Ether and ERC-20 token transfers to/from Safe contracts

The [Available Services](available-services.md) contains a list of APIs that can be used to track transactions on different networks.
