# ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

## What is a Smart Account?

A Smart Account (also known as a Smart Contract Account) is a bank account with fully customizable rules. If you think of your regular bank account or crypto account (Externally Owned Account, EOA), itâ€™s a simple key and sign account. Anyone with the key (password) can sign anything (approve sending money out of your account).&#x20;

This means that if someone got access to your username and password, they can take all your money. It also means that if you forgot your password, then you have to go through a lengthy password reset process with a regular bank account and if itâ€™s a crypto account, your money is gone forever.\


With a Smart Account, itâ€™s fully customizable, so you can create any type of rule you want. The most common type of rule you can create is a multi-signer account. For example, instead of having just one password (or private key) control your account you can have it done by multiple people. You can add 3 other people (or companies!) that you trust to be signers of your account. Then if you want to send any transactions, at least 2 of them have to approve the transaction.\


Another common rule is to set a spending limit. You can set a limit that allows you to withdraw amounts under $100, without needing approval from everyone else. However, for larger amounts you could require 2 other people to sign and approve the transaction.\


When you change the very idea of an account from something that is simply using a password or private key to approve transactions, to something that is fully customizable from the ground up, the possibilities are endless. This guide will show you some of the possibilities and give you the resources to make those possibilities a reality.

### How to Read this Guide



There are three main sections in this guide: Learn, Build, Discover.

1. Learn about how Smart Accounts work.
2. Build cool things with Smart Accounts.
3. Discover what other people are building and using with Smart Accounts



We recommend starting with Learn and seeing some tutorials there to learn more about how Smart Accounts work. Then, head to the Discover section to get some ideas and inspiration for the types of things possible with smart accounts. Then, complete one of the Build tutorials and make an app that uses Smart Accounts.



You can follow the [Ecosystem Diagram](https://viewer.diagrams.net/index.html?tags=%7B%7D\&target=blank\&highlight=0000ff\&edit=\_blank\&layers=1\&nav=1\&page-id=atRejJyS5DeNAtDboIeV\&title=Safe%20Diagrams.drawio#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Fuc%3Fid%3D1WcTgdHoQttJ0K\_fV8mDg-RmDZRYGe3D-%26export%3Ddownload) as an example.\
