This section lists the addresses of all the Safe contracts deployed grouped by version and chain. The same list can be found on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-deployments), from which these pages are automatically generated.

The most recent version of the Safe contracts is `v1.4.1`, which adds compatibility with the ERC-4337. However, it is not supported yet in the [Safe{Wallet}](app.safe.global) interface and the Safe Transaction Service. For that reason, depending on your use case, it might be recommended to continue using `v1.3.0` until there is better support.
