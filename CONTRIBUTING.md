# Contributing

Thank you for contributing to the Safe docs. Before starting, please review the existing documentation to understand the structure and writing conventions.

We use the [Microsoft Style Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/) for the styles and [Vale](https://vale.sh/docs/) for linting. This combination helps us use the style guide effectively.

## Using Vale

Install the [Vale CLI](https://vale.sh/docs/vale-cli/installation/) and run the following command: 

```
vale --glob='*.md' .
```

You can also use Vale as a plugin for your IDE.
