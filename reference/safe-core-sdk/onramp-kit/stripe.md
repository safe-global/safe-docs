## Stripe

The [Stripe Crypto OnRamp service](https://stripe.com/docs/crypto/overview) allows individuals to securely purchase cryptocurrencies from your application.

### Install Dependencies

```bash
yarn add @stripe/stripe-js @stripe/crypto @safe-global/onramp-kit
```

### StripePack

The `StripePack` allow you to use the Stripe Crypto OnRamp services with Safe. You need to create an instance of the pack and pass it to the `SafeOnRampKit` `init` method.

This pack provides a customizable widget for users to purchase cryptocurrencies using Stripe services. It can be rendered in any chosen CSS selector on a webpage.

#### `StripePack(stripeConfig)`

```typescript
const stripePack = new StripePack(stripeConfig);
await SafeOnRampKit.init(stripePack);
```

**Params**

- `stripeConfig` - The configuration for the Stripe pack. The options are:

```typescript
StripeConfig {
  stripePublicKey: string
  onRampBackendUrl: string
}
```

The `stripePublicKey` is the public key for your Stripe account. You can get one using [your account](https://stripe.com/docs/keys#obtain-api-keys)

The `onRampBackendUrl` is the URL for the backend that starts a session with Stripe. For more information on how to create the server, refer to the [official documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/crypto/quickstart#init-stripe). You can also check out the example application and server in the [Safe{Core} SDK monorepo](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-core-sdk/tree/main/packages/onramp-kit/example/server).

**Returns**
An instance of the `StripePack` class implementing the `SafeAuthPack<TPack>` interface for being used with the `SafeOnRampKit`.
