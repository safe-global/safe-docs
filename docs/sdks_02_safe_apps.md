## Introduction

With over $1B worth of digital assets held in Gnosis Multisigs alone, it’s essential for the dapp ecosystem to access the untapped market of multi-signature wallets. Safe Apps introduce a completely new way for developers to build their dapps right into a Multisig interface. Turn your Dapp into an HTML iframe component that can be accessed through the Safe Multisig. We are providing extensive developer tooling to make it easy to develop, test and integrate Safe Apps into the Safe Multisig. This includes a unique design system, reusable components and a Safe App SDK that facilitates the Safe App <> Safe Multisig communication.

Please refer to this [EthCC3 talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GirpNHZPJM&t=168s) to learn more about Safe Apps.

There are already Safe Apps available for a number of popular protocols such as [Aave](https://aave.com/), [Synthetix](https://synthetix.io/), [1inch](https://1inch.exchange/) or [Balancer](https://balancer.finance/). These have been build by 3rd party developers or the projects themselves.

If you are missing a Safe App, get in touch with the respective project or get building with the Safe Apps SDK below. There is even a grants program available:

### Safe Apps Grants

We have an ongoing program to finance the development of Safe Apps through grants with up to $3000. These grants are meant as an incentive for the community to extend the functionality of the Safe Multisig and enable small projects or independent developers to build their first Safe App.

Find more information about our grants program [here](https://github.com/gnosis/GECO/blob/master/Project%20Ideas/Safe%20Apps%20Grants.md).

### On-chain stats

There are Dune Analytics dashboards about Safe Apps available:

- [Number of transactions](https://explore.duneanalytics.com/dashboard/gnosis-safe---safe-apps-transactions)
- [Transaction volume](https://explore.duneanalytics.com/dashboard/gnosis-safe---safe-apps-volume)

## Development

### Safe Apps SDK

The Safe App SDK is a software development kit to integrate third-party applications (Safe Apps) with the [Safe Multisig interface](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/).

[Find documentation on the Safe App SDK here](https://github.com/gnosis/safe-apps-sdk)

### UI Kit

We provide Safe App developers with reusable react components to make it easy to build Safe Apps with a near-native look and feel while still allowing to enable developers to use their branding in the Safe Apps.

## Release Process

### How to get your Safe Apps into the hands of users

As soon as you are done developing and testing your Safe App, you can already let some actual users test it by just simply sending them the link to the hosted Safe App and asking them to add it as a Custom App. [This guide](https://help.gnosis-safe.io/en/articles/4022030-add-a-custom-safe-app) explains how to add custom apps.

### Get your Safe App listed in the Safe Multisig

To organically reach Safe Multisig users, you want to have your Safe App directly listed, of course. For Gnosis to list your app, the Safe App needs to fulfill the following criteria:
The Safe App manifest includes all the required information

#### 1) Your Safe App must include a manifest.json file that contains the following data:

- `"name": "Name of your Safe App"`

This is the official name of your Safe App, with a maximum of 20 characters.

- `"iconPath": "your_logo.svg"`

A file path to the logo that will be used alongside your Safe App. The icon must be a square SVG image of at least 256 by 256 pixels.

- `"description": "This is the Safe app description."`

Describe the functionality of your Safe App in 50-500 characters.

- `"providedBy": {"name": "Example organization", "url": "https://example_organization.com"}`

Your company or personal name and link to your company or personal domain.

An example manifest can be found on [Github](https://github.com/gnosis/safe-apps-sdk/blob/master/packages/cra-template-safe-app/template/public/manifest.json).
An example Safe app on ipfs can be found [here](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmTgnb1J9FDR9gimptzvaEiNa25s92iQy37GyqYfwZw8Aj/).

#### 2) Gnosis has reviewed the Safe App

While we won’t be able to do a proper audit for your Safe App, we still would like to take a look at the source code to raise issues or suggest improvements. Depending on whether your Safe App is open or closed source, please send us either a **link to the public repo or an invitation to the private code repository**.

We also would like to make a rough functional review of the app, so please provide us with a **high-level test plan / feature list** that allows our QA team to make sure everything works as intended in production.

#### 3) The Safe App is hosted on IPFS

While we allow interacting with Safe Apps hosted on a regular web server through the Add custom app feature, we require listed apps to be hosted on IPFS. This ensures users can trust in the app being available at any time in the future without relying on the Safe App being hosted by the developer. Gnosis will take care of uploading your app to IPFS, but will require a **compiled version of the app** to do so.

Gnosis runs its own IPFS node and will make sure to pin your Safe App to guarantee availability.

#### 4) Help us decode your Safe App transactions

We want to display interactions with Safe Apps as humand-readable as possible. To do this, we need the contract ABI of the contracts that your Safe App interacts with. The ideal way to do this would be to verify your contracts via [Sourcify](https://github.com/ethereum/sourcify), which we can leverage to decode transactions interacting with those contract.

Alternatively, you can provide us with the ABIs as JSON files or the links to the verified contracts on Etherscan, so we can implement transaction decoding for your Safe App interactions.

### Official launch and beyond

After we have reviewed and integrated your Safe App, the app will first be available in the staging versions ([Rinkeby](http://safe-team-rinkeby.staging.gnosisdev.com/app/#/) / [Mainnet](http://safe-team-mainnet.staging.gnosisdev.com/app/#/)) of the Safe Multisig for you to do a final review. We would then approach you to coordinate the launch and a joint announcement.

At any point after the launch, if you or your users encounter issues with the Safe App, or you want to release an update to an existing Safe App, please get in touch with us.

safe@gnosis.io or via our [Discord](https://discord.gg/FPMRAwK)


### Disclaimer

It is at the sole discretion of Gnosis to list or delist apps from the Safe Multisig. Safe Apps are not owned, controlled, maintained, or audited by Gnosis.
