# Safe Documentation

> Safe is an open-source and modular account abstraction stack that enables secure management of digital assets. It's the essential tooling and infrastructure for integrating secure Smart Accounts, with over $100B+ in assets secured and 200+ projects built on top of it since 2018.

Safe brings digital ownership of accounts to everyone by building universal and open contract standards for the custody of digital assets, data, and identity. The documentation covers the Safe{Core} tooling and infrastructure for developers to integrate Safe Smart Accounts into their applications.
